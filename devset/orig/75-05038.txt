In Sophocles' « Ajax », the hero's shift from outcast to cult figure can be understood by examining, from the perspective of those looking on, his refusal to accept the judgement of arms. The opening scene with Athena (1-133) recalls Il. 1, 193-194. The agon over Ajax's body (1046ff.) implicates the audience in reevaluating Ajax's dissent. In the final scene, Odysseus, the traditional enemy of Ajax, creates the conditions for the burial to take place (1316ff.). This paradoxical conclusion has been brought about by the chorus, who foreshadow the role we too must play if we are to try to find a way out of the agon other than violence.
