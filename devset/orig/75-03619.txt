In the hexameter poem « The Foundation of Lesbos », preserved by Parthenius, FGrH 3 B 479, the anonymous poet operates in a markedly Hellenistic fashion and subtly but unmistakably invites a reading of his marginal tale against the larger context of the Trojan War as it is related in the « Iliad » and the « Odyssey ». The author of the poem was probably relatively obscure : he may have been Alcaeus of Mytilene, whose epigrams are preserved in the Greek anthology (cf. P.Oxy. 3711 fr. 1, i, 17ff.).
