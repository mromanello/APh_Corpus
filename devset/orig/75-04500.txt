It has been suggested by (among others) S. Levin (=> 56-03861) that the famous lacuna at De Pythiae oraculis 409 could be a « conscious erasure » that deleted Domitian's name after his damnatio memoriae. Militating against this view are : 1) the likely dates of Plutarch's life and work ; and 2) the numerous lacunae in the extant manuscripts, which represent words and phrases illegible to the copyists.
