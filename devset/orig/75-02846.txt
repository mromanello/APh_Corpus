The dominant conception in classical rhetoric of how innate ability relates to education (Quintilian 2, 19, 2 ; Plato, R. Books 2-3 and 6-7) should be questioned. Isocrates' ambivalent affirmation of and resistance to a highly determinant version of aptitude (4, 150-151 ; 13, 5-6 ; 15, 291-305) may represent a productive strategy in order to reinvigorate contemporary inquiries in language, human nature, and ethics.
