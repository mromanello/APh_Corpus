The artistic evidence afforded by a portrait of a young boy from Fayum (Malibu [Calif.], J. Paul Getty Museum, inv. 78.AP.262) suggests that the boy was quite sick, and that extreme measures were taken in order to return him to good health. The most poignant of these measures may be seen in his tufted hairstyle, a manifestation of an indigenous Egyptian remedy. In such an extreme case of mortal illness it is quite probable that the child's parents would use all varieties of medical and religious cures available to them, regardless of whether they were Greek, Roman, or Egyptian.
