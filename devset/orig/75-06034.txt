Theophrastus HP 6, 8, 1-4 wrote that flowers were in bloom at every season of the year, even in winter. He credited wreathmakers with prolonging the season of flowering from fall into winter and coaxing plants into bloom early. He names two flowers, identified as gilliflower (stock) and wallflower, that begin to bloom in late winter, and several fall flowers (autumn-blooming narcissus and crocus, and smilax) that continue blooming into winter ; but he treats as unusual two plants, violet and oenanthe, that can be kept in bloom all year by extraordinary tendance.
