Ovid claims in the « Fasti » that he will honor the imperial family by celebrating the « arae Caesaris » (fast. 1, 13), by which we should understand all types of « sacred area » set up or revitalized by the Julian family. There is, in fact, only one monument whose appearance is described, namely the Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum Augustum (5, 545-598). Analysis of Ovid's treatment of the Temple of Castor and Pollux (1, 705-708) ; Livia's shrine (6, 637-648) ; the Temples of Aesculapius and Jupiter (1, 289-294) ; the Temple of Juno Sospita (2, 55-66) ; and the Ara Pacis Augustae (1, 709-722) suggests that one reason for Ovid's distinctive handling of imperial monuments, particularly the absence of the visual, might lie in his exile.
