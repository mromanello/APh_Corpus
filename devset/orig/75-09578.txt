The bronze coinage with the type of a lily (representing the Hasmonaeans) and anchor (symbolizing the Seleucid kings) struck at Jerusalem from 132/131-131/130 B.C. in the name of Antiochus VII (SNG Israel nos. 2133-2150) should be reinterpreted as a sign of the Hasmonaean state's relative autonomy. This coinage ended with the death of Antiochus VII, but the anchor and the lily reappeared on the coinage of Hyrcanus' son, Alexander Jannaeus, to illustrate the continuity of his reign with his father's. After the fall of the Hasmonaeans the anchor-symbolism reappeared on several series of bronze coins struck at Jerusalem under Herod the Great and was used even after his death
