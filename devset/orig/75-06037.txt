[Aristotle], Problemata inedita Books 2-3 ed. U. C. Bussemaker (Paris, 1857) includes some thematically grouped sections that include a large number of items also found in [Aristotle] « Problems » included in I. Bekker's edition (Berlin, 1831-1870), and others that do not. The subjects of some of the latter correspond to the titles of three lost works by Theophrastus. Given the use of the works by Theophrastus in the Bekker « Problems », and of his « On dizziness » in the Bussemaker « Problems », the possibility suggests itself that material from the three lost works may be present in the Bussemaker « Problems ».
