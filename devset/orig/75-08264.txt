A dozen Roman engraved gemstones (intaglios) dating from the 1st cent. B.C. to the 3rd cent. A.D. were found during the1968-1978 excavations by the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University below the southern and western enclosure walls of Temple Mount in Jerusalem. An intaglio (cat. no. 2) depicting Tyche of Aelia Capitolina is the sole representation of the city-goddess in any medium other than city coins. The snake coiled around an altar (cat. no. 7), a representation of the Genius of the wearer of the gem, has parallels only on wall paintings. The depiction of Telemachos (cat. no. 6) riding a quadriga is the first known depiction of that scene. Other figures depicted on the gemstones include Mars, the imperial eagle, Helios, and other images.
