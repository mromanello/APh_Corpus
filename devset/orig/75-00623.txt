According to one view, Aristotle explains the desirability of friendship as following from the definition of a friend as « another self » and from the principle that self-consciousness, the awareness of oneself and one's activities, is in itself highly desirable but difficult to attain. So friendship is a kind of awareness of self that is easier to attain. But this is not the argument that Aristotle makes at EE 7, 12, where he argues instead that subjectivity can be enhanced by the possibility of a « we-subject » in friendship. This may require us to see consciousness more on the model of collectic psychic phenomena such as language.
