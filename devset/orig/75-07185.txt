The address system of Egyptian documentary Greek papyri reveals some of the most unusual developments in post-classical Greek, for there is an almost complete discontinuity between classical Attic forms of address and those of Egyptian papyri of the Roman period. When all the evidence is assembled, there is only one good explanation for the address system of the papyri : the classical Greek system died out in the Hellenistic period, and in the early Roman period a new system was created under Latin influence. Data are collected from a corpus, the « Heidelberger Gesamtverzeichnis der griechischen Papyrusurkunden Ägyptens » (2002), consisting of all known letters and petitions from the 3rd cent. B.C. to the 8th cent. A.D.
