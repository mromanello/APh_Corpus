Built in the 1820s, the folly beside the lake at Virginia Water is located in Windsor Great Park. In the form of an idealized Classical ruin, it incorporates a large collection of Roman antiquities from the site of Lepcis Magna in Libya. As a consequence of the relatively little scholarly attention the site has received, a thorough survey and partial excavation of the site were undertaken in the summer of 2003 under the auspices of Reading University. The results of the work, a detailed plan of the ruins, a catalogue of the items remaining and new evidence for the origin, construction and history of the site, are presented. A total of 139 items were recorded during the course of the survey. These have been grouped into four main categories : bases, column shafts, capitals and miscellaneous items.
