Although the MM III B and LM I A ceramic phases of the Neopalatial period have in central Crete recently been subjected to refinement and revision, in the east of the island they are still not very clearly defined. It is often argued that these phases see important changes in Minoan political geography, with Knossos seemingly extending its influence farther than ever before. Thus closer definition of these phases in east Crete in relation to the center of the island represents an important step. It is in light of this that three deposits from Palaikastro should be considered in order to clarify the nature of the MM III B and LM I A phases in east Crete. The deposits in question were excavated during the British School excavations conducted between 1986 and 1996. The deposits are from Building 6, Area 6 and Building 2 and contain 477 catalogued pots in total.
