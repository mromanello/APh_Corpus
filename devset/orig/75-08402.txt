Excavations along the southern flank of Poggio Civitate's Piano del Tesoro plateau conducted from 1997-1999 by investigators from various institutions have added to the understanding of the structures present there during the Orientalizing period of this region (ca. 675/650 and 600/580 B.C.). The foundation walls uncovered beneath the southern flank of the Archaic Period building in the 1968 campaign were recognized (by K. Phillips [=> APh 40, p. 436]) to be of a date earlier than that of the structure itself. Further examination has helped clarify these foundations and define the general plan of the building. The structures in this area appear to form a complex of related buildings sharing similar terracotta roofing systems.
