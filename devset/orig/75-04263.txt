Diotima's account of the highest kind of love is that its real object, whatever the conscious aims of the lover (the philosopher) may be, is not the contemplation of Beauty but the permanent possession of the good in the form of true virtue (207 D). This true virtue is not a state of the philosopher's soul, but his external discourses handed down to posterity, and it is true in the sense of issuing from knowledge, not opinion. The philosopher's external discourses are aimed at the virtue of others, and it is this that renders him dear to the gods.
