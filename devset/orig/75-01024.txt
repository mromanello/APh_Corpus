In the fifth book of Boethius' « Consolatio », when Boethius cannot see that divine foreknowledge preserves human freedom, Philosophy gives him a formula that distinguishes different kinds of seeing and different powers of knowing (5, 4 ; 5, 6). This formula is the key to unlocking both the significance of the dramatic story and the structure of the philosophical argument. Boethius' consolation is in Philosophy's weaving of drama and argument together, such that her dress, which is the work of her own hands, comforts in sorrow and leads upwards to joy.
