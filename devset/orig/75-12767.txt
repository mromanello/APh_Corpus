A black-figure hydria (Reading [Pa.], Reading Public Museum 30.301.1) attributed to the Alkmene Painter resurfaced after a century out of sight. Reassessment of the hydria leads to a modified attribution and revised ideas about the black-figure painters working in Athens during the late-6th cent. B.C. Style, novel compositions, and the syntactical practice of repeating figures across fields to create narrative connections and paradigmatic relationships reveal artistic innovation.
