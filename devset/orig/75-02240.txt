Herodotus 9, 108-122 is a multi-layered ending, offering a meditation on the interplay between injustice and excess and the simultaneous existence of human evil and divine justice. Assessing the conclusion's literary merit depends on placing it within its thematic context, that of punishments. Punishments in the « Histories » play a role as literary spectacle, as material for ethnographic and political insight, and as vehicle for an implicit philosophy of history.
