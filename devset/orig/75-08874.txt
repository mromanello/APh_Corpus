Dendrological and dendro/radiocarbon research has raised questions concerning dates for the end of LH IIIA2 and the transition to LH IIIB. The Mycenaean and Levanto-Mycenaean pottery from Kamid el-Loz in Lebanon has added relevant information, as has examination of the material from the Uluburun shipwreck and the Miletus excavation. Analysis suggests that the transition from LH IIIA1 to IIIA2 pottery takes place between 1390 B.C. at the earliest and ends around 1290 B.C. at the latest, with the main transition in many areas occurring no earlier than 1315-1305 B.C.
