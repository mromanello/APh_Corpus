Whereas it is generally assumed that the « Gospel of Thomas » was first composed in Greek, evidence is presented that the Nag Hammadi text was first set down in Syriac. On comparing divergences between the Greek witness to Thomas (POxy 1, 654, 655) and the fuller Coptic version (NHC II,2), it is argued that each of these differences can be readily attributed to the texts' final reliance on a common Aramaic source. In most instances, the hypothesized shared source may be inferred to be of either western Aramaic or Syriac character, but in some cases, the evidence points decisively toward Syriac-speaking provenance.
