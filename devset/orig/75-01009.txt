Bede wrote his « Ecclesiastical History » in order to connect the lives of his English contemporaries with salvation history. To do this, Bede described the English Church as a preaching church offering unity with the universal church seated in Rome. These conclusions are illuminated by consideration of : the political setting in which Bede wrote his history : the significance of loyalty in Anglo-Saxon society and consequently of Bede's ecclesiastical vision ; and other factors.
