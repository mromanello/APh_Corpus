The coins span a period from the time of Augustus to after A.D. 1000, and the collection is composed of 75 Roman imperial and Roman provincial coins and four Byzantine coins. The 3rd cent. A.D. is the period most represented. One interesting peculiarity is the inversion of the letters PF and FP in the legend of the obverse of coin no. 36.
