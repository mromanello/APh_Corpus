Among the published inscriptions relating to the religious life of Lydia and immediately adjacent areas during the Roman period are some 120-130 stelae bearing confession-texts. Their overt function is to record in writing an intervention by a god or gods into human life, often on the occasion of a religious fault or sin committed by the person by whom, or on whose behalf, they were set up. The texts are all in Greek, and the majority of the self-dated texts so far published date to A.D. 120-250. Although there is no single model for confession-texts, it is helpful to treat them heuristically as one grand text generated by a system of ideas, which can be represented as a religious narrative. The confession-stela afforded a means of negotiation not with the god, but with the implied reader, and thus indirectly with the real community.
