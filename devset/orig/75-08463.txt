The Australian Pompeii team has surveyed and documented a number of houses, mainly in Region VII, Insula 4. While studying the building phases of the houses, members of the team explored a number of the underground cisterns that stored rainwater for household use ; they also found sections of lead piping and drains in a number of houses. In Casa del Granduca a complex of pipes and drains was found that served both the mosaic foundation and the kitchen/lavatory area. Includes a summary of the chronology of the eastern side of the Insula, a detailed examination of the water system, and some remarks about the mosaic foundation in the Casa del Granduca.
