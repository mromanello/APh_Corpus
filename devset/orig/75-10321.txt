The favored model of a temporally extensive empire-wide crisis in the 3rd cent. A.D. that instantly and radically altered all areas of human life is not accurate for three reasons : it does not take into account the various structural levels within the overall picture of the empire ; it does not consider the various rates of development in different parts of the empire at different times ; there was no unified scenario but rather various regional expressions that are evident in the later 3rd cent. A.D. The entire process was a long and gradual development, for which the concept of crisis is inappropriate.
