Formal education in elementary logic began in Plato's Academy and can be traced into the Middle Ages. Evidence from Aristotle, « Prior analytics », Apuleius, « De interpretatione », Galen, « Institutio logica », and anonymous sources suggests that many works may have been written to be memorized by students. The views of the Peripatetics and Stoics, originally different, coalesced, and later handbooks covered both at an elementary level. The origin of a concept of a syllogistic mood is obscure ; it may have existed for some time before appearing first in Apuleius.
