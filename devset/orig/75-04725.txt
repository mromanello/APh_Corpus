Consideration of the role of emotional effect in oratory leads to an examination both of the philosophical critique of such behavior and the defense advanced by Quintilian and by Cicero (de orat. 3, 104). The public morality that emerges is more nuanced and more willfully mystificatory than that represented by its critics. Quintilian's lament for his own bereavement (6, pref.) and his claim to reveal a uniquely personal secret gained from experience of himself seeking to move an audience (6, 2) show the rhetor's manipulative control of superficially personal material.
