Plutarch's historical accuracy is matched by a willingness to give in the « Lives » different accounts of the same event ; to disregard chronology ; and to bias narratives so as to fit the moral tendency of the « Life ». How we react to this conflict is likely to determine our reading of the « Lives ». Alex. 1, 1-3, where Plutarch both is at his most programmatic and employs the visual arts as his point of comparison, is exemplary. In the opening chapters of the « Life of Cimon », however, Plutarch uses art as a contrast to his own technique. Comparison of the passages allows the reader to grasp the tension in Plutarch between moral intention and mimetic truth.
