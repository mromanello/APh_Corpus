Doubts persist about the identity and remains of the colossal temple on the Quirinal Hill in Rome, but it can be confidently argued that it is the temple of Serapis built under Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. In addition to the statuary attested in the vicinity of the temple, there is much to be learned from 16th-cent. illustrations of the remains, particularly those of Andrea Palladio in 1570. Eight Proconnesian marble columns that were later incorporated into the Basilica of Maxentius may have been salvaged from the Quirinal temple. These columns, one of which stands today in the Piazza S. Maria Maggiore, may initially have been constructed to adorn the Pantheon's pronaos.
