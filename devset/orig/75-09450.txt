The corpus of approximately 250 Christian inscriptions in Latin dating from before ca. A.D. 700 from western Britain (ed. by R. G. Collingwood and R. P. Wright [=> APh 36, p. 475] with later supplements by others published in JRS and Britannia) may be understood to be neither a new, post-Roman introduction into Britain nor the product of contact with Gaul. Rather, the inscriptions should be seen as part of a larger epigraphic practice also evidenced in Spain, Italy, and North Africa in late antiquity. Christian inscriptions in Britain most likely date from the late 4th cent., a conclusion with important implications for the study of western Britain.
