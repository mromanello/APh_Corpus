Both I. Morris (in J. Ober and C. W. Hedrick => 67-11833 ; and in => 72-10195) and L. Kurke (=> 71-12437) have claimed that the archaic Greek symposium served as the site for an anti-polis ideology. Both argue that material remains and the texts divide into oppositional ideologies : on the one side is an « elitist », anti-polis ideology which can be seen in the practices of gift-exchange and athletic games and in Alcaeus, Sappho, Anacreon, and Ibycus. On the other side is a « middling », pro-polis ideology identifiable through the adoption of coinage, the valorization of the phalanx over the individual, and the practice of moderation ; this is expressed in the poetry of Archilochus, Hipponax, and others. The conceptual underpinnings that guide Morris and Kurke's understanding of the operation of ideology need to be examined. Their respective conclusions about the symposium are not sustained by their own evidence but rest on a set of problematic assumptions about the operation of ideology that they have imported into their analyses.
