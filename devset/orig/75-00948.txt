Augustine's theft of pears in conf. 2, 14-15 is bewildering precisely because it lacks any obvious motivation. But it strikingly reenacts Adam's sin because Augustine is not driven by mere sensual urges or conventional utility. In the end it is only by understanding his solidarity with Adam that Augustine can appreciate his redemption in solidarity with Christ.
