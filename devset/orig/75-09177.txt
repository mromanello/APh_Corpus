Publication of the Greek inscriptions on the seats of the odeum at Gerasa (=> also 75-08982), which designate twelve sections for the civic tribes of Gerasa, and one to be occupied probably by a town council. A later inscription designates a section for linen workers. Inscriptions elucidate the organization of a theater audience in the high empire in a provincial context. Addition of linen workers may reflect social changes in the later empire.
