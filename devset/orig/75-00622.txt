Aristotle defines anger as « a desire, accompanied by pain, for a perceived revenge, on account of a perceived slight on the part of people who are not fit to slight one or one's own » (Rh. 2, 2, 1378 A 31-33). That anger arises from a slight, rather than from other kinds of deliberate harm that another person might inflict, is remarkable. Implicit in the definition is the element of evaluation involving the ability to distinguish between people who have or have not the right to act in determinate ways. The world implied by Aristotle's account is hierarchical, consisting of people who are superior or inferior with regard to strength, wealth, status, and the like. The social situations in which anger is triggered or allayed are informed by a regard for status, protocols of conduct, and the opinion of others.
