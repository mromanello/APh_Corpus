The 6th-cent. A.D. Madaba mosaic map created on the nave floor of the church in Madaba, Jordan shows two main vegetal motifs : the date palm and a mysterious bush. The inclusion of the date palm testifies to its economic importance in the region. The bush is best identified as opobalsam (Commiphora gileadensis), which is known from literary sources to have been grown in the lower Jordan Valley, and elsewhere, in the Roman period (Pliny, nat. 12, 53-54 ; 111-115).
