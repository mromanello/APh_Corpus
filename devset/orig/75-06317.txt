Assessment of the peculiarities of the « gesta martyrum » as a source for late antique and early medieval Rome requires shifting interpretive stress toward an emphasis on factional conflict among lay-clerical coalitions. Analysis of the literary motif recurring across the « gesta » of Lucina, the aristocratic « matrona » or widow who sees to the burial of the martyr on her own lands, can help us trace the role that the memory of martyrs played in texts such as the « gesta martyrum », the Symmachan forgeries, and the « Liber pontificalis », as well as the role that martyr shrines such as the Vatican basilica played in the contestation of Roman episcopal authority.
