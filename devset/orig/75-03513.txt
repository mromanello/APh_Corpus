In dedicating his « Fasti » from exile (1, 1-26), Ovid longed for Rome's male-dominated literary culture, where audience response to the recitation of works-in-progress guided composition. Such a desire for alternating cooperation and competition among men drives the poet to construct Germanicus as an ideal adviser and literary guide. Erotic and military metaphors in the dedication and in subsequent prefaces (fast. 3, 1-12 and 6, 1-8) position both the author and his unfinished poem as passive objects of the potentially active, editorial desire for a Roman male readership.
