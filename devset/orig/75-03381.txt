The terms « tragedy » and « praetexta » refer to what are usually considered to be two distinct genres. From this apparent contradiction many of the persistent puzzles about the « Octavia » seem to flow : its structure ; its chorus, which sometimes dwells in the world of Roman history, at other times in the realm of Greek myth ; its marginalization in historical and literary scholarship. But this hybridity makes the « Octavia » striking as poetry and unexpected as a form of historical record.
