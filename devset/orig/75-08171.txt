A new unpublished closed pottery group from northern Karpathos (Avlona) consists of fourteen tableware vessels, which date mostly to the LM/LH III A 2 and LH III B 1 periods. Typological and stylistic analysis of the pottery showed that the finds probably came from two different cultural territories : the mainland (Mycenaean area) and Minoan Crete.
