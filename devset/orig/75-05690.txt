The Gospel of John had a powerful impact on the early Church not only in its theological understanding of God, but in its conviction of the centrality of worship. In the Fourth Gospel, worship is made possible through the Spirit who gives birth to believers, making them children of God and participants in Jesus' own filiation. The Johannine Jesus, through the Spirit, becomes both the locus and object of worship, the source of worship as well as the true worshipper. This understanding is the ultimate source of the Nicene Creed's assertion that all three Persons of the Trinity are to be « worshipped and glorified ».
