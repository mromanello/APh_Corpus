Pliny's letters documenting his villas (2, 17 and 5, 6) contain a number of seasonal references to summer and winter, sun and shade, winds and storms, and heat and cold. Although the notion of owning distinct summer and winter residences doubtless appealed to Pliny's self-image as a leisured aristocrat, this notion will have been secondary to the landowner's need for agricultural profit.
