The ostensible function of Cicero's « Brutus » is to record the history of oratory at Rome and thereby confirm that it has ceased to exist under Caesar's dictatorship. But the gulf between Cicero's ideal of oratory and its actual use means that he is unable to implement his inclusive selection criteria, as the absences of Marius, Sulla, Catiline, and Clodius from the catalogue indicate ; and his discussions of speakers have to concentrate on technique and not content. While the narrative logic of the work tends toward Cicero himself as the culmination of Roman eloquence, his failure to inscribe himself into the canon shows that he is not yet willing to withdraw from political activity and cease to be an orator.
