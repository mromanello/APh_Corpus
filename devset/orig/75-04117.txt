J. E. Annas (=> 70-03878) gives one of the few modern discussions of the claim in the digression section of the Theaetetus (172 C-177 C) that man's end is assimilation to God. Her view that it is a contemplative ideal, however, ignores the fact that the digression makes it explicit that one can become assimilated to God only by living a just life, and a just life manifestly involves human interactions. A correct account of the nature of the « otherworldliness » involved in the contemplative ideal shows how this apparent paradox can be relieved.
