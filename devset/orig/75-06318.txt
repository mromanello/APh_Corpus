Discussion of the « Passio Saturnini » (BHL 7492) is dominated by the orthodox view that the Abitinian martyrs it describes were venerated by both Catholics and Donatists, and that their hagiography provides evidence for the outbreak of the Donatist Schism. This interpretation of the text rests upon a number of false assumptions regarding its manuscript tradition and the celebrity of the martyrs it commemorates. Rather than being written in the early 4th cent., the text in its extant form was probably written after the Council of Carthage in 411, and perhaps in response to it. It thus casts light not upon the outbreak of the schism, but rather on the way in which the events of the early 4th cent. were polemically reinterpreted at a much later date.
