Report on the 2002 season of excavation undertaken by the American School of Classical Studies at Azoria in eastern Crete ; work concentrated on the peak of the South Acropolis and the occupational phases of the 7th-6th cents. B.C. A « spine wall » was discovered connecting the three Archaic structures ; this wall suggests an element of urban planning and large-scale organization not apparent in the architecture of the neighboring Early Iron Age villages. The recovery of a possible « andreion complex » suggests the urban character of the site in the 6th cent. B.C. and forms a starting point for discussing the political economy of the archaic city.
