On Socrates' avowals and disavowals of knowledge in the standardly accepted early Platonic dialogues. Alleged avowals of knowledge have been variously misinterpreted. Six sincere Socratic avowals or assumptions of ethical knowledge occur among the early dialogues. There are inconsistencies among Socrates' avowals and disavowals of ethical knowledge, yet most recent attempts to resolve them fail. Plato uses Socrates in various ways in various texts in order to achieve certain pedagogical objectives, and Socrates' utterances do not all have the same hermeneutic status. In conclusion, the function of Socrates' occasional avowals of ethical knowledge is explained, and an account is given of the ethical epistemological commitments Plato intended to advance in the early dialogues.
