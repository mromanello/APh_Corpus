A project jointly organized by the Palestine Exploration Fund (London) and the Association for the Understanding of Ancient Cultures (Basel) has focused since 1999 on the east side of the Wadi Farasa in the Nabataean site of Petra. The two main terraces of the Wadi Farasa East were connected with smaller secondary terraces by steps. The main monument of the upper terrace is the so-called Garden Temple, perhaps used for cultic purposes. The complex of the Soldier Tomb on the lower terrace should be dated no later than the 1st cent. A.D. This complex reflects features of luxurious architecture in that the central courtyard is surrounded by porticoes with two axially flanking main rooms as they appear in palaces of the late Hellenistic and Roman imperial periods.
