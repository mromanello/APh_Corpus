On the dialogues between Protagoras, Theodorus and Socrates, emphasizing the importance for this passage of a dilemma posed for relativism at 161e-162a. The two speeches delivered on Protagoras' behalf contain material that is deeply Socratic, and this feature of the speeches should be interpreted as part of Plato's philosophical case against relativism, reflecting the relativist's own inability to defend his theory from attempts to refute it. Theodorus' role in the refutation of Protagoras is then discussed, and it is argued that his voice is needed to get relativism disproved in the self-refutation argument of 171a-c. In conclusion, a brief discussion of the image of Protagoras at 171d.
