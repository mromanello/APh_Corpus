The Roman fort is located beneath the Norman motte-and-bailey castle, itself under modern farm buildings at Colwyn Castle (Fforest Farm). Sherds recovered in the early excavations suggest a date for the occupation of the fort in the mid-to-late 1st cent. A.D. and possible occupation into the early 2nd cent. A.D. In the absence of evidence of an earlier date, the fort has hitherto been accepted as a Flavian foundation. There is now reason to consider an earlier date, based on the presence of two samian dishes and strengthened not only by the apparent large size and the shape of the fort, but also by the awkwardness of the location between it and the Flavian fort at Castel Collen.
