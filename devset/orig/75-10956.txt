Bronze Age use of iron is limited to palatial jewelry. Sporadic contacts with Cypriot blacksmiths skilled in steelworking led to the development of Aegean iron blade production. The needs of new chiefdoms started a process : from the 10th cent. B.C., iron weapons and then tools replaced bronze for cutting. This expensive alloy was not effective because of a shortage of tim and the quality of poor remelting. The Aegean, rich in iron ores easy to access and smelt, offers autonomy to metalworkers and their clients in self-sufficient villages. During the Geometric period iron became an exchange resource for the city-states and the basis of Greek currency.
