Callimachus' short narratives contain a number of instances of direct speech. In Hymns 1, 2, and 3 brief narrative sequences alternate with descriptions of the gods ; in these hymns, speech emphasizes the encomiastic function and connects the hymns as part of a collection. Hymns 4, 5, and 6 contain longer narrative passages ; here, speech helps to structure the narrative. Overall there is a certain tendency in the hymns and « Aetia » to use speech to enhance the focus on parents and children.
