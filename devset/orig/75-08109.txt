The Turkdean Roman villa, probably dating to the 2nd-early 3rd cent. A.D., was examined over ten days in 1997 and 1998 for two « Time Team » television programs. Finds include : a block of coarse oolitic limestone that may date to the 4th cent. inscribed with the letters « FIL » ; 58 coins dating primarily to the 4th cent. ; 2 509 sherds of pottery dating almost entirely to the Roman period ; and a knee brooch bearing the motto « VTERE FELIX » and dating to the second half of the 2nd cent.
