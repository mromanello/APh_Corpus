F. Kolb (=> 75-08812) describes Late Bronze Age Troy as an insignificant settlement that played at best a negligible role in the politics and trade of its day. He does so by excluding Troy VII from the discussion of Late Bronze Age Troy, by a very selective reading of the published data on Troy VI, by defining concepts such as « city » or « trade » in an extremely narrow way, and by denying archaeology the right and ability to address questions of ancient economies. Nevertheless, the substance of M. Korfmann's claims (=> 65-09880 ; 68-08322 ; 69-08462 ; 72-10066) hold firm when tested against the evidence : Late Bronze Age Troy was a settlement consisting of a citadel and a fortified Lower City covering between 25 and 35 hectares ; it was by far the largest site in the Troad and may be termed the capital of a city-state that encompassed the Troad ; the finds, the unique geographical position of Troy, and the evidence for contact between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age, indicate that it played an important role in trade.
