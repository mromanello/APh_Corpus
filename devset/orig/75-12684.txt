The return of Hephaistos to Olympos concerns the establishment of a balance of power among the Olympian gods. Many visual representations in Archaic and Classical Greek art give visible form to this theme, but in a manner distinct from that in which it is expressed in literary narratives of the tale. Vase-painters incorporated elements of Dionysiac processional ritual into representations of the return of Hephaistos in order to articulate visually the principal theme of the myth. To judge from the aetiological myths associated with them, the epiphanic processions symbolized the triumph of Dionysos over, and his belated acceptance by, those who denied his status as a god. By structuring the visual representations of the return of Hephaistos along the lines of such Dionysiac processions, artists conveyed visually the idea that the myth also concerned the triumph of a god over those who rejected him, and his acceptance among the Olympians
