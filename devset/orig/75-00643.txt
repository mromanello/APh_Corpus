Difference modes of knowledge are adumbrated in EN 1139-1141 and APo 72-100. The modes illustrate an epistemic gap between experience of individuals and understanding of universals that is troubling for empiricists. Aristotle's account of induction is subject to this worry, but his theory of perception, his teleologically-driven reliabilism about the senses, and his broader metaphysical views about the relation between substance and accident serve to insulate his account of induction from the problems faced by modern empiricists.
