The Roman tradition about Crassus' defeat in 55 B.C. (e.g., Cicero, diu. 1, 16, 29 ; Valerius Maximus 9, 4, 1 ; Plutarch, Crass. 14, 4) is not just of antiquarian interest, but illustrates ways of thinking that were fundamental to Roman views on the just war. Crassus' defeat is an example of a phenomenon that was important in Roman international relations : the military disaster that was perceived as a national disgrace that justified, even required, a war of revenge and conquest.
