The Athenian decree honoring Zeno of Citium is considered to be a source for the social status of philosophers in Hellenistic Athens. A remarkable aspect of this source is that the text has not come to us as an inscription, but is quoted by Diogenes Laertius in his « Life of Zeno » (7, 10-12). In spite of the convincing form of the decree, the possibility of a forgery or - most likely - the manipulation of an historical document should not be ruled out. Analysis of the motivation clause shows elements that do not fit the pattern of, or are incompatible with the nature of, honorary inscriptions. It is not possible to decide whether Apollonius of Tyre, Diogenes' source, himself copied the decree or consulted a collection.
