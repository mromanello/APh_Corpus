Repeated ambiguities concerning the question of whether or not Aeneas and Dido were married cannot be resolved. Aeneas' denial that he entered into a marriage (4, 338-339) is unexplained and requires the assumption that Juno's activities in the cave were ineffectual ; the statement that Dido « used the word marriage to cloak her lapse » (171-172) is ambiguous and blurred by a reference to « furtive love » ungrounded in the rest of the narrative ; passages supporting Dido's motivation (18-19 and 551-552) are made suspect by language implying sexual impropriety. None of these objections is clear-cut ; everything is open to alternative explanations.
