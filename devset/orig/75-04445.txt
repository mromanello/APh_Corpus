Comparison of Plotinus' thought with images and concepts from the « Papyri Graecae magicae » and the Nag Hammadi Codices suggests that Plotinus derived the central aim of his life and his philosophy - namely, that of mystical union - at least in part from contemporaneous ritual practices that were thought to enable the practitioner to « conjoin » himself with a god. This thesis has implications not only for our understanding of the sources and nature of Plotinus' thought but also for the broader issue of the relationship between the categories of magic, religion, and philosophy in the late antique Mediterranean world.
