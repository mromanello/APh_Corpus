Study of handbooks on the composition of progymnasmata by Aelius Theon, Pseudo-Hermogenes, Aphthonius, and Nicolaus enables us to describe and interpret what Greek students in the imperial period learned about the events of the past, and from what literary sources they derived this knowledge ; what assumptions they developed about the methods and goals of history-writing ; and the extent to which training in the progymnasmata prepared students to invent alternate histories for use in declamation.
