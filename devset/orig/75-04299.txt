At Poen. 1146 « sine modo » should be interpreted « beyond measure » and regarded as the continuation of Hanno's answer : « clarus clamor - sine modo ». Loud screaming may be identified with a woman's tool of the trade (« supellex », 1146). Alternatively, « tace… parce muliebri supellectili » in 1145 may imply that the screaming depends on the furnishings characteristic of a woman's sex, i.e. her breasts. This would coincide with notions from Peripatetic physiology that women scream with their bosoms (Aristotle, Aud. 803-804 A).
