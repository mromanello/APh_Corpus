The use of astronomy software makes possible a systematic re-examination of the astronomical references in the « Fasti » and a review of the previous authority on the question, Christian Ludwig Ideler, in « Über den astronomischen Theil der Fasti des Ovid », Abhandlungen der königlichen Akademie der Wissenschaft zu Berlin aus den Jahren 1822-23, 137-69. In light of these findings, Ideler's astronomical method and conclusions appear to be sound, although modern classicists have tended both to misrepresent Ideler's findings and to doubt the skill and accuracy of Ovid's astronomy. Most (three out of four) of the more than 50 astronomical references in the poem are valid within a narrow range of days. The poem contains a small but not statistically insignificant number of evident errors and/or confusing references. Each of these errors poses problems of its own and deserves closer scrutiny.
