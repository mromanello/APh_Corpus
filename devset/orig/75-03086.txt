Elements of Lycophron's tragic writing and of his rewriting of the tragedians must be sought in his « Alexandra », although this obscure work is not a tragedy in the classical sense of the word. Yet identifiably tragic elements in Cassandra's diction invite the reader to read the text as tragic. Study of the vocabulary of marriage and relations, of murder and destruction, and of pain and lament in the « Alexandra » reveals its relationship to tragedy.
