A feature in the worship of Hercules at the Ara Maxima was its exclusion of women (Gellius 11, 6, 1-2). Although a passage in the « Origo gentis Romanae » of Pseudo-Aurelius Victor maintains that Appius Claudius in 312 B.C. had allowed women's admission to the Ara Maxima's worship, Macrobius (1, 12, 28 and 3, 12, 2-3), provides contemporary testimony that women were not allowed to participate. Pseudo-Aurelius Victor's claim may have been an attempt to provide a rationale for Hercules' wrath, suggesting that it was the attempted admission of women that truly angered him.
