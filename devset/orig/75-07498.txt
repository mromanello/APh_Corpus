According to B. Bischoff (=> APh 38, p. 333), the list of classical and a few 4th-cent. authors and their works found in the MS Berlin, Staatsbibliothek, Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Diez B. Sant. 66 is a partial record of Charlemagne's court library. However it is no longer possible to accept the Diez manuscript-list as one of the codices gathered together at the pre-Aachen Frankish court, and therefore the core of its book collection. The work of reconstructing what was available in the palace « armaria » has to begin anew, not least by exploiting the evidence of texts used by the first generation of court scholars in their own writings. Nevertheless some conclusions regarding the prose and verse of pre-Christian antiquity, as well as other works, can be drawn.
