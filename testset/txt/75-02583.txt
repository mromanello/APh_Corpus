The many types of persuasive act found in the « Iliad » may be clustered under four dominant sources of appeal that transcend situational constraints : honor (illustrated, e.g., at 1, 253-258 ; 9, 283-285 and 13, 95-96), material gain (1, 20-21 and 21, 74-80), power (6, 111-112 and 13, 236-237), and justice (3, 351-354). 
 These four sources reflect the dominant cultural values of archaic Greece of the 8th-7th cents.
