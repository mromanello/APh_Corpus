The « Acts of Xanthippe and Polyxena » (BHG 1877) adds to our understanding of the late antique world of female same-sex relationships. In its production of the relationship between Xanthippe and Polyxena, the « Acts » replicates the reciprocal bond that characterized lovers in the Greek novel. At the same time, the « Acts » contests the ideal of the female same-sex bond through the views embodied in the male characters. A Foucaultian framework enables the examination of of the sociopolitical agendas that may have contributed to the formation and policing of such female same-sex commitment.
