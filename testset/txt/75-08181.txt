An examination of the literary (Pausanias 2, 3, 6-2, 4, 5 ; Plutarch, Arat. 40 ; AG 6, 212), epigraphic, and archaeological evidence suggests that the prominent Archaic Doric temple at Corinth was dedicated to Apollo. In further support of this identification, a previously-unpublished Archaic terracotta pinax, possibly inscribed with a dedication to Apollo, is presented. The plaque is now lost.
