A Greek inscription in the Museum of Aphrodisias (inv. I 01.001) newly published by the author (=> 75-09071) was erected by the philosopher Alexander of Aphrodisias in honor of his homonymous father, T. Aurelius Alexandros. The most important biographical information provided by the inscription is the fact that Alexander was also the son of a philosopher. The inscription throws new light on the vivid intellectual life at Aphrodisias in the late 2nd or early 3rd cent.
