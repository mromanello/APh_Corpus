Fragments 138a-f and 574a-b of the « Forma Urbis » show a long stretch of the right bank of the Tiber, opposite the Aventine.
The buildings are not monumental, but rather are structures and spaces related to river commerce.
They face onto a road that forms the continuation of the route of the via Campana-Portuensis, already identified on another slab of the « Forma ».
