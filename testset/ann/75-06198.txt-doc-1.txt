In the introduction to ecl. 8, Vergil 's unnamed patron is imagined as sailing either past the Timavus river or along the shore of the Illyrian sea at the time when the poet might some day celebrate his achievements.
The choice of the Timavus (6) is potentially significant for what it suggests in metaliterary terms, particularly in relation to Callimachean poetics, in that it links celebration of the unnamed patron 's deeds with a body of water of epic proportions.
The « Illyricum aequor » (7) is also not only like the sea (« aequor »), but also « not lyrical » (Illyricum) - accordingly, epic.
