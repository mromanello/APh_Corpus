Xenophon 's interest in Euphron, tyrant at Sicyon from 368 to 366 (HG 7, 1, 44-46 and 7, 3), is part of his general approach to tyranny in the « Hellenica », which depicts a series of individuals and regimes, all described as tyrannies. The model of tyranny with which Xenophon operates is broader and more inclusive than the narrow, constitutional idea defined by Aristotle 's « Politics ».
Understanding this has two consequences : it allows us to appreciate Euphron in a new light and see the debate that existed in his own time about his role and position ; it also raises the question of Xenophon 's attitude toward tyranny.
Xenophon needs to be seen within the evolution of ideas about tyranny as constructed by historians : Herodotus described tyranny in the aftermath of the Persian Wars, while Thucydides developed the concept from the individual to the general, as this better fitted his Athenocentric model.
Xenophon, in contrast, was reflecting contemporary debates over the interpretation of different types of ruler and regime, and developing his own theory of tyranny.
