Argues for a date of 253 A.D. for the synod of Carthaginian bishops mentioned by Cyprian in Epist. 57. Comparison of Cyprian's use of the verb « censere » with classical and Christian usage enables determination of the extent to which the bishops at the synod of 253 expected their decisions to be implemented. The synod's decisions were offered as pieces of advice to other bishops rather than as orders.
