Located at the foot of the Palatine Hill, the Septizodium, a monumental façade fountain, was built during the reign of Septimius Severus. None of the building's structure above ground level survives today ; it is nevertheless possible to speculate about its original appearance and sculptural program. The Septizodium was the crown jewel of a monumental zone created by Severus along the approach to the Palatine and the city's center. It would have epitomized the major themes of Severan dynastic ideology : first, that Severus and his heirs were the legitimate successors of the Antonine emperors ; second, that divine providence had sanctioned this succession. This evidence suggests that the Septizodium was a grandiose nymphaeum whose façade was populated with statues and other ornaments in the style of nymphaea in the Greek East. The imagery of this façade reflected dynastic propaganda in the context of the celebration of Severus' decennalia, the triumphal procession honoring his Parthian victory, and the wedding of Caracalla to Plautilla.
