Contrary to the standard view, the « Choice of Heracles » preserved at Xenophon, Mem. 2, 1, 21-33 is not a summary or paraphrase, but a very close approximation to the actual wording of Prodicus' epideixis. The language and style of the passage are uncharacteristic of Xenophon, and the fact that Prodicus' original was known to exist in both written and orally performed versions serves to explain why the piece is framed by language that disclaims strict accuracy in reproducing it. The way in which near-synonyms are used in the piece is not necessarily inconsistent with other evidence for Prodicus' practice : it is rather the personified character Vice whose usage conflicts with that of Prodicus himself and with that of the personification of Virtue. The « Choice of Heracles » represented the contents not of Prodicus' advanced teaching, but of the popular lecture intended for a general audience.
