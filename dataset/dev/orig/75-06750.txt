There is sufficient evidence to establish the existence of inserted apposition in classical Greek poetry. This is true both of appositions consisting of adjective-noun combinations (e.g., Aeschylus, A. 119 ; Euripides, Hipp. 1037 ; Pindar, N. 6, 3-4) and of those consisting of a noun with a genitive dependent upon it (e.g., Aeschylus, Eu. 302 ; Pindar, N. 4, 2-3). At the same time such appositional word orders always remained rare in Greek literature, in contrast to the situation in Latin, where they established themselves as a minor literary mannerism.
