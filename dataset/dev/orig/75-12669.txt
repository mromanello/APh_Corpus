The existence of several architectural decoration-items adopted from Greek architecture may suggest that local craftsmanship in Ancient Israel was influenced to some extent by Greek artistic design but not necessarily by Greek building methods. A summarized synthesis of the architectural decoration in the repertory of the Hellenistic period in Israel (from the 3rd to the 1st centuries B.C.E.) is presented, as well as the circuit of use, the types of buildings and settlements, the decoration served, and its date of appearance. The sculptural remains appear to be mostly imported as they are made of marble from various Mediterranean quarries and are of non-oriental craftsmanship.
