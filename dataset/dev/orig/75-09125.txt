A Greek inscription from a private collection in Fethiye (Oguz Kocagil, n° 38) tells part of a court case concerning the illegal sale of land to « foreigners », who are identified as Lycians. It may be argued that the land belonged to Rhodes' mainland possessions bordering Lycia, and that some of the individuals named in the inscription are to be identified with members of a prominent 2nd-cent.-A.D. Rhodian family. Possible locations for the land are at Daidala or the island of Meis/Castellorizo.
