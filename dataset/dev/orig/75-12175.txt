Augustine, epist. 2* recounts the tribulations of a Spanish monk Fronto in his efforts to prosecute what he regards as a heretical conspiracy among the clergy of Hispania Tarraconensis. Fronto's narrative is a rare first-person account of the late-antique judicial process in all its complexity of overlapping imperial and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. The letter provides evidence for judicial strategies and rhetoric as well as for the roles of status, power, and violence in influencing legal outcomes.
