The representations of anger in Chariton's novel support the view that the novel has two implied readers, distinguished by gender. Callirhoe may be regarded as a woman whose love for her husband overrides an unjustified physical assault (1, 4) ; this perspective would seem to appeal to the male view of desirable female behavior. On the other hand, her ability to resist anger endows her with a strength that marks her, in ancient terms, as an unusual and admirable woman and offers a model to which female readers can aspire in an empowering way.
