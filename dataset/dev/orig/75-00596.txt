It is correct to read « Posterior analytics » as saying that a genus is studied scientifically through first determing the infimae species that fall under that genus. The view is mistaken that Aristotle is primarily concerned with determining the definitions of the infimae species that fall under a certain genus by collating definitional predications to see which are common to which species.
