There are two contemporary views of the authorial purposes of the « Rhetoric » : one maintains that Aristotle valued democracy and understood rhetoric to be a form of positive civic discourse (e.g., G. Hauser [=> 70-00640]) ; the other suggests that Aristotle's purpose was to instruct members of the Academy and Lyceum in the necessary evil of using rhetoric to deal with the ignorant masses (e.g., C. Poster [=> 68-00638]). The first view is not supported by the Aristotelian texts. The second view needs to expand the contexts within which the « Rhetoric » is understood to include the transmission and editorial history of the Aristotelian corpus before any purpose can be ascribed to Aristotle without so much qualification as to make the ascription meaningless.
