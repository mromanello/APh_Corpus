Remains discovered in excavations carried out by the Archaeological Section of the Soprintendenza di Messina at Naxos in 1981-1983 have now been firmly identified as the dockyard of the Greek city ; see P. Pelagatti (=> 54-07552) and M. C. Lentini (=> 60-09716). One rock-cut shipsherd has been excavated for its surviving length (the lower end is lost under modern buildings) ; there is pottery evidence for the construction of its north wall in the mid-5th cent. B.C.
