Revisits various chronologically relevant aspects of the so-called « Carmen contra paganos ». In particular, the recent identification of the anonymous praefectus and consul with Vettius Agorius Praetextatus is challenged, by reasserting the classical identification with Virius Nicomachus Flavianus. The composition of the poem can thus be dated to the aftermath of the battle at the Frigidus (5-6/9/394) on firm grounds, and new light is shed on the careers of Leucadius, « rationalis rei priuatae fundorum domus diuinae per Africam » ca. 388/90 and Marcianus, « proconsul Campaniae » ca. 393/94. In conclusion, new paths of further research on the poem and on late Roman religious conflicts are suggested.
