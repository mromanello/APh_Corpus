Very little is known about the Dacian falx, a long scythe-like weapon with a hooked point, other than the information that can be obtained from the Roman war memorial at Adamklissi, the representation found on the base of Trajan's Column, and a representation on an inscription at Birdoswald on Hadrian's Wall. Based on these images it has been possible to recreate and test the scythe ; experimentation shows that the physical and psychological impact of the widespread use of these weapons against Roman troops with standard armor would have been considerable.
