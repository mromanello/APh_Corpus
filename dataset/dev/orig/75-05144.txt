The death of Parthenopaeus in Theb. 9, 570-907 is modelled on that of Camilla in Aen. 11, 803-819 and is portrayed as a defloration. The death may thus be read within a framework of boy versus man, and couched within terms of femininity ; that is, his feminization underscores his lack of masculinity. The imagery usually associated with elegy (snow-white countenance, hairlessness, languid appearance) enhances the intimations of erotic beauty.
