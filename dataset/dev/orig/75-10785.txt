It is believed that, in wartime, legionary detachments or « uexillationes » were commanded by senatorial and later equestrian officers, whereas centurions were entrusted with detachments raised for garrison duty or work-related tasks in peacetime. However, literary (e.g., ps.-Hyginus) and epigraphic sources (CIL 3, 6052 ; 6, 421 ; 10, 5829 ; 14, 3612) suggest that, even from the mid-1st cent. A.D., the usual leader of fighting-detachments of up to 500 legionaries was the centurion.
