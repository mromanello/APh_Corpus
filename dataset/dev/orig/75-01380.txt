Plato proposes in Lg. 720 C-723 A that persuasive proems should precede legal enactments. This proposal seems to have influenced Cicero's prefaces in leg. 2, 15-16 and 3, 2-5. Cicero's greatest debt to Plato where the proems are concerned lies in the use of philosophical themes to establish a mood in which the legal enactments that follow may be accepted.
