In the study of the alternative reconstruction of Eudoxan planetary theory (=> 69-01602) the hippopede (a figure eight created by the intersection of a sphere and a cylinder) acquires an analytical role, consolidating the theory's geometrical underpinnings. This removes the main point of incompatibility between the alternative reconstruction and Simplicius' account of Eudoxan planetary astronomy. The analysis also suggests a compass and straight-edge procedure for drawing a point by point outline of the retrograde loop created by any given arrangement of the three inner spheres.
