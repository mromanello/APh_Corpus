The elements of Homeric feasting - values, practices, vocabulary, and equipment - offer interesting comparisons to the archaeological record. These comparisons enable one to detect the possible contribution of different chronological periods to what appears to be a cumulative, composite picture of around 700 B.C. Homeric drinking practices are of particular interest in relation to the history of drinking in the Aegean. Various kinds of material evidence are considered along with Linear B ideograms.
