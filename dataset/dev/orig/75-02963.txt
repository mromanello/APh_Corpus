At 1, 35, 2 Livy tells us that Tarquinius Priscus was the first to seek the kingship « ambitiose ». Book 1 gives a glimpse of three stages in the evolution of « ambitio » : the neutral « ambitio » of office-seeking (1, 35, 2 and 1, 46, 1-2) ; an excessive « ambitio » associated with a too-zealous cultivation of one's political power (1, 35, 6) ; and « ambitio » in the service of outright political degeneracy. Dionysius of Halicarnassus 4, 40, 1-3 may be conjecturally linked with Livy 1, 35, 2. According to Dionysius, Servius Tullius bypassed the procedure for the creation of a new king, presenting himself directly to the people. Dionysius seems to describe a change of political behavior that looks like the one Livy locates at the time of Tarquinius Priscus' accession and calls innovatory.
