Hieronymian hagiography is a remarkably plastic genre, raising questions of fact vs. fantasy, history vs. romance, and the meaning of « holy man ».
The « Life of Paul the hermit » experiments with a radical disruption of the genre of romance ; « On the captive monk » eschews the world of mythical beasts in favor of the plausibly realistic realm of novelistic discourse while cleaving more closely to the conventional plotline of ancient fiction.
In the « Life of Hilarion » Jerome plays with the generic conventions of hagiography.
