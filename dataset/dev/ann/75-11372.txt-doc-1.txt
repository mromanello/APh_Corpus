Three dynastic settlements were (re)founded by the Ptolemies in Cyrenaica : Arsinoe-Taucheira, Ptolemais near Barca and Berenike near Euesperides.
A papyrological text (P. Lond. 7 1986) so far ignored by scholars attests citizens of Ptolemais near Barca as early as 252 B. C. in Egypt and refutes the argument that all three Ptolemaic cities were founded under Ptolemy III Euergetes (246-221 B. C.).
Ptolemy I Soter had the motives, opportunity and resources to found Ptolemais as early as the end of the 4th cent.
B. C.
