The meaning of Julian 's bull coinage has been little agreed-upon.
It is worth reconsidering a theory formulated by J. P. C. Kent (=> APh 26, p. 381, under Kent, 2nd title), who argued that the legend should refer to the Emperor himself and cited Dio Chrysostom, Or. 2, 66-67 as the source of the symbolism.
This text would have been of interest to Julian given its allusion to Homer, where Agamemnon is described as the bull in a herd of heroes (Il. 2, 480-483).
Julian was in fact compared to a bull in his own lifetime (in Himerius, fr. 1, 6 ed. Colonna).
