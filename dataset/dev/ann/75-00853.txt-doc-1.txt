Augustine offers a response to Vergil that is unusual in western tradition.
In « Confessions », the « errores » of Aeneas are analogous to the physical and spiritual « errores » of Augustine (conf. 5, 18, 4), and Vergil provides words that express Augustine 's experience (conf. 1, 17, 27).
But in « City of God », the « errores » are Vergil 's.
In this work the cultural imperium of Vergil is like the imperium of Rome : Vergil, like Rome, is an impressive example of the flawed human culture that is all we can achieve on this earth since human pride first prompted disobedience to God 's will (ciu. 4, 1 ; 5, 12 ; 15, 9).
As Augustine 's book progresses beyond refutation of the claims of Roman gods, Vergil becomes less and less prominent.
