Comparison of 1) the characterization of the main personalities appearing in Tacitus, ann. 14 and in the « Octavia », 2) the depiction of the nature of the crowds in the riot scenes, and 3) the dialogues between Nero and Seneca leads to the conclusion that Tacitus knew the « Octavia » well and that he appears to make some personal responses to it, most notably at ann. 14, 63 (cf. Octavia 931).
