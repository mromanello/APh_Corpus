In Virgil 's representation of history, the series of wars from Troy to Actium can be understood in terms of the enmity between two genealogical lines, the dynasties of Dardanus and of Inachus (e. g., at Aen. 7, 371-372 [ Turnus ] ; alluded to, e. g., at Aen. 1, 338 [ Dido ]).
The narrative portrays the interpretation of those genealogies as acts dependent upon their rhetorical, political context.
By dramatizing the deployment of validating myths, the « Aeneid » provides a commentary on the relationship between myth and power in the Roman world.
