A Roman provincial coin struck at Damascus under Volusian (Israel Antiquities Authority No. 64790) depicts on the reverse an image paralleled by depictions of the metamorphosis of Daphne.
The myth is known to have been connected with Antioch in Syria (e. g., Pausanias 8, 20, 2), but the paucity of literary evidence for Roman Damascus leaves us with no indication of why this scene should have been used on the coin.
