The rites to Tacita presented by Ovid at fast. 2, 533-638 occur as an interlude between the family festivals of February.
In both a literal and figurative sense, the old woman stands at the threshold of the narrative.
As a liminal figure, she has several functions : her rites serve as a segue from the Feralia to the Caristia ; but also present an inverse portrait of the themes of these holidays.
The story of Lara (593-616), placed during the Feralia, shows Lara as a victim of silence.
But earlier in his exegesis of this holiday Ovid presents the dead as vociferous in their response to familial impiety (547-556).
The account of Caristia (615-622) resolves these complications.
