Two Hellenistic decrees (SEG 45, 1556 and 1557) found at the sanctuary of Zeus at Panamara in Caria honor the Stratonikeian citizen Leon son of Chrysaor for his role as priest of Zeus Karios.
These two texts complement a third (IS 7) found at Panamara.
Together these inscriptions improve our understanding of the process of city formation in this part of Asia Minor, in that they throw light on the relationship between the Seleucid foundation of Stratonikeia, which became one of the major cities in this area, and the Carian communities and sanctuaries that formed its building blocks.
