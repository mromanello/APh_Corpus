By emphasizing that a political entity is a communal partnership, Aristotle implies at EN 1141 B 25 that Plato 's city is not yet bona fide political.
Owing to his reluctance to draw a clear distinction between the private and public realms (e. g., R. 397 E and 554 D-E), Plato 's political theory tries to meet conflicting demands.
By examining Aristotle 's solution to Plato 's paradox, we can appreciate the peculiar relation between Aristotle 's political justice and justice per se, and the political significance of Aristotle 's distinction between the public and private realms (EN 1133 A 26-1134 B 8).
