Various aspects of the decoration and technology of the locally-produced Mycenaean IIIC:1 pottery assemblages from Tel Miqne-Ekron and Ashdod are examined in terms of statigraphic context, regional distribution, and subsequent development.
This synthesis of the initial phase of the philistine ceramic corpus makes it possible to establish firm typological links between this assemblage and the Later Helladic IIIC Early and earlier part of the Late Helladic IIIC Middle periods in the Aegean, and with the transitional Late Cypriote IIC/IIIA and Later Cypriot IIIA periods in Cyprus.
An absolute date during the second quarter of the 12th cent.
B. C. can be proposed for the beginning of the Philistine settlement on the southern Coastal plain of Israel.
