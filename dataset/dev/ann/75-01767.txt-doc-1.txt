On whether or not Epicurus was a psychological hedonist : that is, did he hold that all human action, as a matter of fact, has pleasure as its goal?
Or was he just an ethical hedonist, asserting merely that pleasure ought to be the goal of human action?
The recent attempt by John Cooper (=> 71-14752) to answer the latter question in the affirmative fails to make his case.
There is considerable evidence in favour of a psychological reading of Epicurean hedonism, evidence that includes some of the very texts that Cooper cites in support of the ethical reading.
