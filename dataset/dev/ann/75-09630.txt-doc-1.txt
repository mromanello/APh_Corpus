The production of forgeries developed at Châteaubleau, particularly during the mid-3rd cent.
A. D. The study of the sites where coins were cast is a particularly important aspect of analysis of forgeries, and three officinae have been revealed in Châteaubleau through surface survey.
These officinae are significant because of their high number and varied locations.
Another unusual feature of the officinae is the variety of denominations that were being struck and cast : the silver denarius, the main coin used to pay the troops and civil servants ; the antoninianus or radiate, introduced by Caracalla at the end of 214 ; and the double sestertius, bearing a radiate obverse bust of the emperor.
