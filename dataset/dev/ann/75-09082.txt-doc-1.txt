Offers the text and translation of a new fragment of the so-called Beersheeba tax edict (actually an imperial rescript, probably of the emperor Justinian), a marble slab containing nine lines of Greek text discovered during salvage excavations at Beersheba in 1996.
Interpretation of the original inscription as a whole : abuses in the collection of an unspecified tax required the emperor to issue a pragmatic sanction with an attached schedule of the amounts to be paid by various fiscal units of the country.
Appendix : text and translation of fr. 2-3 of the same edict, as well as of fr. 4, after the text edited by Alt (Die griechischen Inschriften der Palästina tertia westlich der Araba, Berlin 1921 => J. Marouzeau, Dix années de bibliographie classique, 2, Paris 1928, p. 810)
