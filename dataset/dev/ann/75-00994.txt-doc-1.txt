Basil of Caesarea 's Trinitarian thought changed in the 360s, and the dates of his Trinitarian works, especially ep.
9 and « Contra Eunomium », determine the nature of the change.
Most have dated these works such that Basil must be judged at least inconsistent if not duplicitous.
The evidence reconsidered, though, yields a date early in the 360s for both ep.
9 and « Contra Eunomium ».
Since it cannot be determined which came first, Basil should be presumed consistent.
