Demosthenes ' and Aeschines ' insulting depictions of one another highlight the mouth as a vehicle for communicating ideas about intemperance.
Much of the imagery in the speeches lampoons oratorical delivery, especially vocal tone and deportment, which project the speakers ' characters.
While Demosthenes is a piping chatterbox (Aeschines 2 and 3) and Aeschines a voluble shouter (Demosthenes 18 and 19), both extremes are characterized by a misuse of the mouth and its vocal organs.
These portrayals of the mouth 's capacities contribute to a larger abusive discourse that develops around professional speakers during this period.
