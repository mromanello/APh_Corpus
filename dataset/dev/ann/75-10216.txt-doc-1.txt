The defeat of Regulus in 255 B. C. proved crucial in determining the subsequent course of the First Punic War, not because any particular advantage accrued to the victorious Carthaginians, but because the Romans were led thereby to abandon a strategy that was essentially correct (Polybius 1, 41, 4-5).
Having conceived the plan of carrying the war into the Punic homeland, the Romans allowed their mistakes to deflect them to a plodding strategy, postponing Roman victory for over a dozen years.
