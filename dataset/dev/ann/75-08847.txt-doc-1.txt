« Minoisation » is a modern term for a heterogeneous range of traits and practices of ancient material culture that indicate the adoption in places beyond Crete of ways of doing things that originated within Crete.
Examples include artifact styles and consumption, cooking habits, writing, weight systems, weaving, wall paintings, design and use of built space, burial practices and ritual action.
At a general level, Minoisation is related by common consent to the expansion on Crete of complex palatial polities during the early to mid-2nd millennium B. C. The interpretation of every other aspect of the phenomenon remains controversial, especially in regard to the implications for understanding the nature of social, economic and political relations between Crete and its neighbors.
