The creation of a distinctive identity is characteristic of earliest Christianity, and bound up with its production of an equally distinctive literature, particularly that of the New Testament.
Many of the concepts defining this identity have Jewish roots, but the Christians rejected what they saw as the particularism of Judaism, claiming to be open to all and yet to be tied to no particular race or location.
The anonymous late 2nd-cent. epistle « ad Diognetum » illustrates this concept of identity.
