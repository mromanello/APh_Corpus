Results of the 2003 season of excavation in the Wadi Farasa East, supported by the Palestine Exploration Fund (London) and the Association for the Understanding of Ancient Cultures (Basel).
The excavation focused on the main retaining wall, entrance area, porticoes, and courtyard of the lower terrace ; and on the cistern and garden triclinium of the upper terrace.
The installations of the excavated area clearly reflect aspects of contemporary Hellenistic and Roman « luxury architecture » in the 1st cent.
