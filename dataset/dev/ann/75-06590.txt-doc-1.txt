Aulus Gellius ' image of the night writer (praef. 4) was not new within the prose literature of imperial Rome (cf. Seneca, epist. 8, 1 and Pliny, nat. praef. 18).
Quintilian explains that the best time to develop fluency in writing is at night in the practice referred to as « lucubratio » (10, 3, 26-27).
This practice put the writer in the role of « paterfamilias » exercising his economic and religious powers, whose night activity served to extend the day of labor rather than to invert the hierarchy of public day over private night.
Comparison with theories of rhetorical training and with traditional constructions of nighttime activity in Roman technical and moralizing discourses reveal the codes - cultural, historical, and literary - in relation to which the figure of the nocturnal writer must be understood.
