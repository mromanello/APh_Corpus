In fr. 1, 4a 4b DK, Anaxagoras appears to support an ontology that includes an unlimited (apeiron) number of stuffs.
P. Tannery in « Pour l'histoire de la science hellène » (Paris, 1887) and J. Burnet in « Early Greek philosophy » (London, 1892) held that these stuffs were assemblages of qualities, which thus are the real building-blocks of the world.
But the Tannery-Burnet view is false : Anaxagoras ' theory makes better philosophical sense as a non-reductive account of nature.
