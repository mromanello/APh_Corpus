Reexamination of the Athenian tribute quota lists assigned to 421/0-415/14 B. C. (IG I3 285-290) suggests that the epigraphic and historical arguments employed by the ATL editors in the reconstruction of these lists are on the whole not cogent.
In some cases, epigraphic anomalies such as differences in lettering and the uncertainty of joins may challenge the association of fragments within lists.
It is possible that many fragments could equally well be dated to the period following the increased assessment of 425, a period that currently constitutes the sole gap in the reconstructed tribute record.
