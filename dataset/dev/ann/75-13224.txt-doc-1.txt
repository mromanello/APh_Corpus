The question whether and in which way(s) sacred authorities intervened in judicial matters and legal disputes deserves study.
Asia Minor is a suitable area for such study because of the abundance of Greek documentary sources (primarily « confession- » or « propitiatory inscriptions » from Lydia and Phrygia from the 1st-3rd cents. A. D.) and the existence of traditional sanctuaries, some of which had considerable property and most of which exercised social and moral influence on the population.
We may conclude that the priests possessed only one means of implementing order : public imprecations.
