Three landscapes that illustrate Statius ' debt to Ovid are the sacred grove of Diana (Th. 4, 419-442), the Nemean grove (Books 4-6), and the river landscape of the Ismenos (9, 360-373).
These landscapes are disconnected from the gods and provide a canvas on which Statius displays the evil of a civil war that burst beyond the bounds of the warring parties.
Humans are held accountable for the destruction of the state as much as for the loss of a paradise described in Ovidian terms as a « locus amoenus ».
