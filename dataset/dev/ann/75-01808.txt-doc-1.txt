It seems clear that Belus of Babylon held a place of importance in Euhemerus ' « Sacred History ».
The significance of Belus lies in the fact that the Babylonian god was regularly identified with Zeus.
Euhemerus (cited by Lactantius, inst. 1, 22, 21-23 and Diodorus 6, 1, 10) justified the syncretism of various local and regional cults by positing that they had a common origin in the worship of this traveling Zeus.
The example of Belus demonstrates that this syncretism also encompassed foreign cults.
