An account of Plato 's education program that is preserved in Arabic by al-Farabi comes from an unknown Platonist of the pre-Plotinian era, possibly Theon of Smyrna or Galen.
The account purports to reconstruct Plato 's own order of investigating problems, and it aligns with this order of investigation almost all of the 36 dialogues that are included in the standard corpus.
A close correlation between the order of the dialogues and the order of composition is clearly intended.
The relationship between al-Farabi 's account of Plato 's investigations and the depiction of the education of Cleinias in the « Euthydemus » (278 E-282 D ; 288 D-290 D) is particularly well thought out and offers us a valuable ancient interpretation of these scenes.
