The biography of Mani in the « Acta Archelai » of Hegemonius, which contains a great number of completely fictitious elements, was in fact drawn up after the model of Simon Magus, « pater omnium haereticorum », using the works of heresiologists and the apocryphal acts, especially the Pseudo-Clementine « Recognitiones », as sources.
There are a great number of elements in this « Vita Manis » that bear a strong resemblance to the well known motifs of Simon 's life.
Projecting Simon 's life over that of Mani serves as tool to reinforce the image of Mani that Hegemonius tried to convey : that of just another « run of the mill » heretic, one in the long line of the disciples of Simon, and a fraud devoid of any originality.
