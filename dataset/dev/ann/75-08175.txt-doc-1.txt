Under the central courtyard of the Villa Dionysos laid out in the 2nd cent.
A. D. in Knossos, a small-scale excavation was carried out in the summer of 2000 under the auspices of the British School at Athens.
This excavation revealed two layers of PG domestic occupation, with no architectural remains from the intervening periods.
