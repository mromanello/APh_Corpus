As an example of philological decisions based on insufficient evidence, studies Erasmus 's inclusion of the Ciceronian expression « talaria induere » in his « Adagiorum Chiliades » (Adag. 1, 2, 42).
The textual tradition of Cicero 's « Letters to Atticus » (Att. 14, 24, 2) transmits « talaria uideamus ».
While this expression may not be really proverbial, both readings are justificable and should be cited as legitimate variants
