Apparently redundant descriptions of torture in hagiographical texts can be contextualized within a broader late-antique concern with violence and pain.
These descriptions play a central role in constructing the power of the martyr and that of his or her church.
Close readings of Prudentius, perist.
1 and 5 and the « Acts of Gallonius » ed. by P. Chiesa (=> 67-05586) show how the torture process (the « quaestio ») was rewritten to suit the needs of a new era : that of the Church Triumphant.
