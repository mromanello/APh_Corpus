Cicero develops a new view of the state as a partnership in Rep. 1, 39.
Like any other partnership, the state is upheld by the agreement of its members and an allocation of rewards that is proportionate to the contributions.
The ancestral Roman constitution, Cicero argues, surpasses all other constitutions in offering the best division of contributions and rewards.
Although the state is held together by the agreement of the whole people, there is a disparity in the assessment of contributions and rewards among different social groups.
