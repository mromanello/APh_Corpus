It is possible to come away from reading J. Boswell 's work on same-sex unions (=> 65-14126) that Augustine engaged in sexual relations with men.
The actual evidence that Augustine engaged in same-sex sexual activity is missing or underwhelming.
He probably engaged in sexual relations with women before he began living with his mistress ; he lived with her for about a dozen years and seems to have had one other sexual affair before his conversion, after which he led a celibate life.
