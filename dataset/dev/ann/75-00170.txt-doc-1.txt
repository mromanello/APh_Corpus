In his description (26, 10, 15-19) of the earthquake and tsunami of July 21, A. D. 365, Ammianus neither refers directly to, nor has even demonstrably read, other surviving sources, but he does allude both to stories and to providentialist interpretations found in those texts.
It may be proposed that Ammianus alludes to fabulous stories now preserved only in the 9th-cent. accounts by Theophanes (A. M. 5859) and Georgius Monachus (560-561 [ 462 M ]).
Whether or not Ammianus was aware of their common original source, it can be seen that the greater authority of his performance comes from eschewing the more incredible details of other accounts.
The aims of credible writing and providentialism here complement rather than contradict each other.
