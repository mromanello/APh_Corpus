There is no proof of literary connection between Augustine and Iamblichus, the principle exponent of the Eastern Neoplatonists.
Yet even if historical connections to Iamblichus are weak, Augustine should be read with Iamblichean philosophy in the background.
Comparison of Iamblichus, « De mysteriis » and Augustine exemplifies the confrontation into which eastern and western Neoplatonism came with and after Plotinus.
The comparison also shows the philosophical and spiritual nature of humility in both writers, and helps ascertain more precisely where the Christian difference lies.
