The location of the springs of the river Cinyps in Tripolitania may be identified by comparing literary sources with topographic data provided by explorers and by geoarchaeological studies carried out by the University of Rome III mission in collaboration with the Department of Antiquities between 1998-2000.
The springs of the Cinyps were located within a strip 3, 6 km (20 stadia) from the coast in Wadi Caam.
These springs supplied the Hadrianic baths of Lepcis Magna probably by means of the scheme put in place by Q. Servilius Candidus in A. D. 119-120.
The claim by Herodotus 4, 175 that the springs were located near the Hill of the Graces 36 km (200 stadia) from the coast may be considered an error.
