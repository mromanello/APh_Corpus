In the Roman empire, the sun was often used, together with Luna, as a cosmic symbol or allegory for eternity.
The evidence from a wide range of homilies suggests that such symbolism was readily adopted by Christians and was not exclusively pagan.
It is this cosmic symbolism that inspired the Church leadership to elect the winter solstice, December 25, as the birthday of Christ, and the summer solstice, June 25, as that of John the Baptist, supplemented by the equinoxes as their respective dates of conception.
The fact that pagans celebrated a festival of « Sol inuictus » on December 25 did not play a role in the choice of date.
