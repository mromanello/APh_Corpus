Isocrates stands as a major figure in the history of authorship ethics.
His writings characterize originality as a virtue and unoriginality as a vice (4, 8-9), and he defines originality as a competitive enterprise whereby one seizes the opportunity to assert something new about something significant (15, 84-87).
Isocrates ' obsession for achieving originality indicates his desire for fame, fortune, and immortality (9, 3 ; 12, 260 ; Ep. 2, 134).
