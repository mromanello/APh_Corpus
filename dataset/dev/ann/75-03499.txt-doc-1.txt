A cultural tension is inherent in Ovid 's « Metamorphoses » : while most of the « materia » is Greek, Rome is its narrative « telos ».
In the first two books, Ovid both weaves into his narrative some anticipations of Roman history (e. g., 2, 536-539) and evokes the political realities of the principate.
Discussion of 2, 533-832 focuses on Ovid 's confrontation with Athenian culture and his « decentering » of Athens within the world of the poem.
Proleptic references in these first two books balance a pattern of cultural transition from Greece to Rome in the two final books.
