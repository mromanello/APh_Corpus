As a result of a survey undertaken by the authors in 1998 (=> 70-14026), more buildings were recognized below the escarpment to the south of the fort, and two areas were surveyed in spring 2000.
The survey has shown the extent of the Roman fort and settlement on the land above the escarpment and indicated that buildings were constructed on the river platforms below.
The results have shown the layout of a large part of the uicus and distinguished the contrast in layout between the areas to the east and west of the fort ; this difference could only have come about by a conscious decision of the Roman army to zone the land around the fort for specific uses.
