Within the hierarchy of Roman slave-staffed estates, the uilicus was not the only person on the farmstead who carried out managerial duties ; the uilica, a farm manageress, was also regarded by the agronomists as a permanent member of the staff.
The function of the uilica is described by Cato (agr. 10 ; 11 ; 143), Varro (rust. 1, 18), and Columella (12), but the attention that the uilica and uilicus have received in modern scholarship is unbalanced.
Not only is less attention given to the uilica, but her role is often subordinated to that of the uilicus, and the discussion of her economic significance is perfunctory.
Contrary to the common view, the uilicus and the uilica were not necessarily husband and wife.
The title of uilica possessed primarily a professional dimension.
Also, by recognizing the managerial role of the uilica in her own right, not only her economic significance can be discerned, but also the full potential of the villa economy.
The evidence considered is both epigraphic and literary (especially Justinian 's Digest).
