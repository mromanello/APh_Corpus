Linear B tablets and sealings from Thebes, Pylos, and Knossos monitor preparations for communal sacrifice and feasting held at palatial centers and in outlying districts.
The fullest textual evidence comes from Pylos, considered here, with translations of the key texts presented in appendix.
Individuals and groups of varying status were involved in provisioning commensal ceremonies ; prominent among the participants were regionally-interlinked nobility, the « wanaks » and the « lawagetas ».
Commensal ceremonies helped establish a collective identity for inhabitants of palatial territories.
Two land-related organizations, the « da-mo » and the « worgioneion ka-ma », represented different social groups in such unifying ceremonies.
