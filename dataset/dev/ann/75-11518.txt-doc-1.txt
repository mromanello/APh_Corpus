Comparison of what the « Iliad » tells about the early life of Achilles and other young children may be juxtaposed with the theory and advice given by Galen (« De sanitate tuenda ») to the parents of noble Roman youngsters.
Such a comparison not only highlights repetitive themes in the conservative atmosphere of raising Greek children, but also reveals that the « Iliad » presupposes the young Achilles to have enjoyed a normative upbringing.
