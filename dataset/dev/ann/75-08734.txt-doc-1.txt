The Roman fort at Qubur al-Bid was discovered utilizing satellite-imagery prospection during the course of a survey of Mesopotamia.
The fort is located in the Jazira of northeast Syria, a few kilometers south of the Turkish border close to the modern town of Qubur al-Bid.
It is a classic « playing-card » shape, surrounded by double ditches.
On typological grounds, the eclipse of the Severan dynasty is the most likely terminus ante quem.
