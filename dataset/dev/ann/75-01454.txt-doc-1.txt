Studies a series of 21 personal confessions of heresy and statements of recantation produced by individuals in Philadelphia in Lydia, some time between 428 and 431, as preserved in the record of a session of the Cyrillian side at the Council of Ephesus held on July the 22nd 431 (ACO 1, 1, 7, nÂ° 76, 12-31, p. 100-105 = CPG 8721).
These texts, of which the Greek texts are given with English translation, allow us a glimpse of local life, and the varieties of Christian belief, of personal identities and statuses, and of levels of literacy in Philadelphia in the first half of the 5th cent.
They also provide our only evidence for what had happened to heretics in inland Asia Minor who found themselves caught up in Nestorius ' anti-heretical crusade.
