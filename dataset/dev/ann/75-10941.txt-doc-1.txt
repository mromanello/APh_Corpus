As with other aspects of post-Minoan Crete studies, there has been a tendency to accept a pan-Cretan economic model, according to which the elite discouraged the development of a market economy, including the production of coinage, elite display, and manufacture for export, in favor of a subsistence economy in which wage-earners were either foreigners or members of a dependent population.
Exploration of Greek epigraphic and other evidence for the economies of archaic Eleutherna evokes elements of the traditional model, but there are traces of specialist production, of Eleutherna 's participation in trading networks linking her with other Cretan poleis and with the rest of the Mediterranean world, and of the monetization of several kinds of transactions (wages, security, and legal penalties).
There is little reason to conclude that specialist wage-earners were not citizens of Eleutherna.
