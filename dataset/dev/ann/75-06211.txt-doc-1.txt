The presentation of emotions in the « Aeneid » may be examined with a focus on Dido 's trajectory from love to hatred in Book 4 and on Aeneas ' killing of Turnus in Book 12.
Of particular interest are the relevance of ancient philosophical views of emotions, and the linkage between this factor and two other influences on characterization in the « Aeneid » : ideological connotations and intertextuality.
Vergil draws on a variety of philosophical modes of understanding emotions, which contributes to the subtlety of characterization.
The factors examined (philosophy, politics, and intertextuality) may be seen as reinforcing each other.
Aeneas ' killing of Turnus is interpreted on balance as an ethical lapse ; this reading, however, is compatible with a certain type of pro-Augustan stance.
