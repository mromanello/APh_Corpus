Some of Irenaeus ' numerous references to Adam and Eve as children are best taken in the physiological rather than the metaphorical sense (e. g., Haer. 3, 33, 4 and 3, 22, 5 ; Epid. 14), while other of the references are not to childhood in the literal sense.
Both uses function within Irenaeus ' view of creation, materiality, and time.
