The Roman imagery of winter in the mid-2nd-cent. -A. D. mosaic of Neptune and the Seasons (originally from the floor of a seaside villa in La Chebba, Tunisia and now in the Bardo Museum, inv. A 292) is particularly rich in iconography.
Not the least of the abstract meanings of winter is its significance as part of the cycle of the astrological year.
