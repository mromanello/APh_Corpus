The torso and limbs of the Riace Warriors were made employing plaster casts taken from life rather than being cast from molds taken from modeled clay matrixes.
When a bronze sculpture is cast from a clay model, the bottom of a foot supporting the body will be open because it rested on the ground.
On the other hand, a plaster cast taken from life will have feet that are true-to-life.
The method used for the Riace bronzes applies to virtually all life-sized Greek bronze statues from the Late Archaic period onwards and no doubt to most Roman statuary bronzes as well.
