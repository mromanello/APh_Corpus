1) Analysis of Eastern Sigillata (ESA) pottery produced between the 2nd cent.
B. C. and the 2nd cent.
A. D., probably north of Antioch, suggests that imports from its area of production were not diminished by the establishment of the province ; the quantity of Parthian-type pottery, however, outweighed the imported « Roman » pottery.
2) Some imperial coins probably reached Dura while it was under Parthian control, but it is difficult to tell what proportion of these came in with the army in A. D. 115-117 and after 165.
3) The case study of a bath suggests that it was actually a Roman bath to be attributed to the early years of military occupation rather than an example of transfer of cultural values.
