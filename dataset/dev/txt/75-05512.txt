Paul may have been using irony in his commendation of the state in Romans 13. 
 The original audience of the letter shared with Paul a common experience of oppression at the hands of the authorities, and were aware of the abuses that took place in the opening years of Nero's reign. 
 The consequent implausibility of Paul's language would have alerted his readers to the presence of irony. 
 They would have been able to set aside the surface meaning of the discourse, and recognise that Paul was using the established rhetorical technique of censuring with counterfeit praise. 
 While the passage can be read as a straightforward injunction to submit to the authorities, an ironic reading of the text results in a subversion of the very authorities it appears to commend.
