« Error Wattianus » describes a type of « Perseverationsfehler » that occurs when a scribe, having to repeat one of two words that he has just written, repeats the wrong one. 
 It is worth identifying for two reasons : 1) when one sees an erroneously repeated word, the first thing to do is examine the immediate context for another word the scribe ought to have repeated ; 2) one can thus explain otherwise inexplicable errors, for example by confusion of letters. 
 21 examples from various authors are given.
