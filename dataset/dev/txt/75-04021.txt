The « Timaeus » and the unfinished « Critias » are best analyzed as a unit. 
 The contrasting topics of the dialogues (cosmology in the « Timaeus », historicized politics in the « Critias ») may be reconciled if we understand their connection in the field of politics. 
 Plato argues that God's existence and good intentions explain both the laws of the universe and the course of human affairs. 
 In terms of Realpolitik, however, Plato shows that atheistic science and imperialistic policy meet with justified punishment. 
 Hence he engages Critias and Hermocrates - both famous opponents to Athenian imperialism - in the discussion, and announces an end to Atlantis that introduces the topical image of a catastrophic earthquake (Ti. 20 D-25 D ; Criti. 108 E ff.).
