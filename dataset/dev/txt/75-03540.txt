Ovid polemically misrepresents the competing representational projects of poet and emperor. 
 The weaving contest of Met. 6, 1-145 may be read in two ways, the first emphasizing Arachne's will to truth (her exposé of Olympian injustice), the second her will to power (her appropriation of Olympian potency). 
 With these models in mind, the vicissitudes of Ovid's rivalrous identification with Augustus in the « Tristia » may be explored.
