In 1998 a mile-station was discovered along the ancient road east of Abu Kammash, a center identified with ancient Pisida on the basis of the Roman itineraries : the « Itinerarium Antonini » records a distance of 54 miles from Sabratha ; the « Tabula Peutingeriana » of only 53. 
 The Department of Antiquity of Sabratha in collaboration with the Archaeological Mission of the University of Roma III recovered a milestone of Caracalla and another of Diocletian and Maximian. 
 Both bear the number of 54 miles, a distance evidently reckoned from Sabratha.
