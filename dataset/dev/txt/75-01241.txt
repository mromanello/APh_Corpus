In Catullus 61, a marriage song for Junia and Manlius, the bride is the focus of figuration. 
 Catullus constructs three sets of similes in a chiastic ring-format (A : 16-20 ; B : 21-25 ; C : 33-35 ; c : 102-105 ; b : 186-188 ; a : 219-223) in order to chart a shift in Junia's relationship to the wedding images.
