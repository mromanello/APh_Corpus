The fact that we group his predecessors together as « presocratics » indicates that Socrates changed the character of philosophy. 
 Yet it is not easy to determine what change he made. 
 To find out when and why Socrates turned to study human things, we have to put together three retrospective statements he gives about his development in Plato (Phd. 96 A ff. ; Smp. 201 D ff. ; Ap. 21 B ff.). 
 Working on the basis of the supposed chronology of composition of the dialogues, scholars have failed to put these statements together. 
 By doing so, we see that the Socratic turn occurred in two stages : Socrates developed his teaching about the ideas in response to defects he found in previous theories ; he then turned to investigate human opinions in response to the critique of his teaching made by Parmenides. 
 Socrates turned to this investigation in order to solve a philosophical problem : he wanted to show how sensible things « participate » or can be shaped by purely intellectual forms of being.
