Interaction between Ahhiyawa and the Hittites was mainly in southwest Anatolia, and Ahhiyawa was one of the kingdoms of Mycenaean Greece. 
 The Dodecanese Islands may be the seat of the kingdom in question, but they would not have been sufficiently important, since at least one king of Ahhiyawa was addressed as an equal by a Hittite Great King. 
 Of the other possible identifications, only Mycenae possessed the requisite power and international status. 
 The Dodecanese may be the islands mentioned in the Hittite texts both as belonging to Ahhiyawa and as a haven for persons fleeing Hittite retribution.
