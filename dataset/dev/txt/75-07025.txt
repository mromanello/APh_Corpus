In a diachronic survey of the scholarly literature, compares two trends in Greek and Roman linguistics : the theoretical approach, oriented towards the philosophy of language, and the empirical approach, which sticks closer to the data. 
 A new project is proposed, drawing on the results obtained by both trends, and illustrated by the example of tense and so-called subjective modality.
