In order to understand more fully the chemistry and methods behind Roman maritime construction, the ROMACONS (Roman Maritime Concrete Study) team took core samples of ancient Roman concrete structures. 
 In 2002, coring was carried out at Portus and Anzio. 
 In 2003, samples were collected from a pila associated with the fish tank at Santa Liberata and at the harbor of Cosa.
