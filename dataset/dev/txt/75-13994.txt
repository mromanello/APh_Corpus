The force pump, attributed to Ctesibius of Alexandria, was first conceived in the early 3rd cent. 
 B.C. as a piston pushing water out of a tube and was constructed by soldering (or brazing) individual bronze elements. 
 A small number of bronze pumps survive and appear to date from the last centuries B.C. to the 3rd cent. 
 A.D. Philo of Byzantium (Carra de Vaux 192-194), Vitruvius (10, 7, 1-5), and Hero of Alexandria (Spir. 1, 28) all describe a force pump. 
 At some point a new design was conceived that enabled the pump to be manufactured by cutting apertures into a single large block of wood and making them pressure-proof with tightly-fitting plugs and plates. 
 Nineteen wooden pumps are thus far known, all from central and Northern Europe.
