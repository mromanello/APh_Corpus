Theophrastus fr. 716 Fortenbaugh attacks the thesis that differences between musical pitches are quantitative. 
 Analysis of lines 108-122 suggests that we should look for the target of Theophrastus' attack not in Aristoxenus, but in the work of earlier « empirical » theorists. 
 Theophrastus' conception of the empiricists' standpoint may originate in a plausible but probably mistaken interpretation of Plato, R. 531 A-B. 
 Theophrastus' polemic makes substantial use of Aristoxenus' ideas.
