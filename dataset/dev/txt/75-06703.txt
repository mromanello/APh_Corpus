Archaic Greek lyric is different from modern lyric poetry in that it is strongly related to an actual performance context. 
 Underlying recent research on choral lyric has been the assumption that the deictic system should be interpreted as performance-oriented. 
 It may be argued, however, that the relation between the deictic reference system and the performance is more complex. 
 Deixis in such texts may involve not only their (envisaged) performance situation but also the (representation of their) composition circumstances, and may shift from one reference system to the other. 
 In some of Pindar's songs the interplay between these possibilities is exploited in a more refined and self-conscious way than is usual.
