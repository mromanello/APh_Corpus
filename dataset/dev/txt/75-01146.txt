A marble statue base found at Thespiae and first published by A. Plassart (=> APh 3, p. 154) preserves an elegiac couplet about Praxiteles' Eros signed by one Herennia Procula. 
 This poet is here identified as a member of a wealthy Roman family resident at Thessalonica (IG 102, 1, 70). 
 The couplet alludes to a series of epigrams about Praxiteles' Cnidian Aphrodite, but with a key variation that points to the nature of the worship of Eros at Thespiae. 
 Plutarch's « Amatorius » provides parallels to show that the Praxitelean Eros had by the early Flavian period become an object of veneration for women hoping for happy and sexually-fulfilling marriages.
