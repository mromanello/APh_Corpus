An unprovenanced, life-sized head of a woman in Parian marble, which has been in the Nicholson Museum, at the University of Sydney (inv. 66.64), since the 19th century, has been regarded hitherto as a Roman copy of a classical original. 
 Current examination finds that the style and technique of the piece indicate Ptolemaic Egypt as its point of origin, and on iconographic grounds it can be identified as a portrait, likely posthumous, of Arsinoe III, dating from the late 3rd cent.
