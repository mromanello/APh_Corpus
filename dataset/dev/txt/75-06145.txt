On the interpretation of a difficult sentence in Varro (L. 7.29). 
 The text of a fragment of Atellan farce (Fr. VII of Ribbeck's « incerti nominis reliquiae ») embedded in the sentence hinges on the use of « significat », a point which scholars have sometimes failed to appreciate. 
 The fragment as interpreted here throws light on code-switching and characterization in the « Atellana ». 
 Includes discussion of the Oscan word « casnar ».
