Examination of Propertius' relationship in the « Monobiblos » to C. Cornelius Gallus reveals that the speaker's desire for Cynthia is complicated by Propertius' status as a reader of his predecessor's poetry. 
 Poems that share the name « Gallus » (1, 1 ; 1, 5 ; 1, 13 ; 1, 20 ; 1, 21) have a thematic coherence and employ similar rhetorics. 
 The overlapping of poetic and sexual concerns in the relationships between men in the « Monobiblos » is similar to that which has been claimed for the relationship between the poet and his « puella ».
