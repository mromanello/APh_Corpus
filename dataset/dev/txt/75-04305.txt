If Greek New Comedy never presented more than three concurrent speakers, then any scene in the Palliata with four or more concurrent speakers contains innovations. 
 Plautus uses ensemble scenes to underscore lively or dramatically significant symposia, eavesdropping, or family reunions and betrothals, especially at the finale. 
 Terence uses ensemble scenes more pervasively for shorter, calmer, and less significant episodes. 
 The authorship of the Greek original may influence the extent of ensemble scenes. 
 Plautus probably created ensemble scenes by rearranging entrances and exits and by endowing mute characters with speech, often transforming silent women into important speaking characters.
