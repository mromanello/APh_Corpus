Reply to C. E. Carlston and D. Norlin (=> 70-05338). 
 Matthew and Luke do not preserve Q sayings any more faithfully than Markan sayings. 
 This can still be interpreted in support of Q being a single written source, but it is important to recall that the degree of Matt-Luke verbatim agreement is much lower than Carlston and Norlin's figures imply.
