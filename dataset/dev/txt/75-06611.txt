Three passages of imaginative literature from antiquity describe winter on Lesbos in extreme terms : Alcaeus fr. 338 (Lobel-Page) ; Longus 3, 3 and 3, 10 ; and AP 9, 95 (Alpheus of Mytilene). 
 Each writer describes accurately the occasional circumstances in which Lesbos experiences extreme cold, but each chose also to emphasize features that reflected their different visions of the island and its inhabitants.
