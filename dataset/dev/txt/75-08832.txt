The palace of Alkinoos described in the « Odyssey » (7, 81-102 and 7, 112-133) poses a problem for archaeologists and Homerists because it is both significantly different from the generalized image of the Homeric palace and unlike Bronze and Iron Age Greek architecture. 
 The « Odyssey » drew on Near Eastern palatial architecture in order to achieve an epic distancing effect in its description of Alkinoos's palace. 
 The effect of this narrative approach contributed to an air of geographical and temporal remoteness that may have been geared toward an audience familiar with stereotypical accounts of Near Eastern palaces. 
 Archaeological data suggest a parallel specifically with Assyrian palatial architecture of the 9th-7th cents.
