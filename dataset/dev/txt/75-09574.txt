A previously unpublished gold medallion of the Constantinian period (in the National Museums of Scotland, registration no. H.C262) that was not included in the survey by G. Depeyrot (published in R. Doty and T. Hackins, eds. => 71-16191) represents a minor variant of the type. 
 These medallions were clearly not coins. 
 It is possible that they were military merit awards of some sort.
