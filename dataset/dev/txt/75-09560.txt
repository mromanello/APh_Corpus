Catalogue of 167 coins and similar metal objects from Qasr Ibrim, discovered on the west side of a Meroitic temple in the course of the Egypt Exploration Society excavations in 1974 (cf. J. M. Plumley, « Qasr Ibrim 1974 », in JEA 1975 61 : 16-17). 
 The coins fall into two groups : 1) 33 bronze and billon coins dating from Ptolemy III to Commodus found at the west side of the temple area ; and 2) 127 bronze coins found west of the entrance of the temple. 
 These date from Probus to Arcadius, some of the latest being very worn from long circulation.
