Whether voluntary or forced, winter campaigning was an element of warfare in the classical world. 
 The heroic feats of great leaders under such conditions consequently became a standard « topos » of literature (Xenophon, An. 4, 4, 11-12 and 4, 5, 7-8 on himself ; Pliny, paneg. 12, 4 on Trajan), although many descriptions of the winter prowess of various leaders are imaginative (Paneg. 11, 9 on Maximian ; Claudian 7, 93-101 on Theodosius).
