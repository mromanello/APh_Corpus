Basil's Homily 21 « On detachment » and his « In Lacizis » may provide similar glimpses of his philanthropic rhetoric during his mission to appoint bishops for Armenia in 372 and 373. 
 While these sermons demonstrate many of Basil's usual themes on poverty relief and justice, they avoid his usual appeal to civic loyalty and family patrimony, potentially explosive topics in this volatile border region. 
 References to arson against the church (Hom. 21, 9) and to loud external disturbances (the opening of « In Lacizis ») may hint at local opposition to Basil's presence or at other relevant theological or political loyalties at play during his visit. 
 These texts may contribute to a deeper understanding of 4th-cent. episcopal presence in regions of political variance and tension.
