A statistical investigation into the relationship between granary floor area and garrison in Roman forts suggests that for a year's grain an auxiliary infantry cohort was typically allotted five square feet of granary area for 500 men. 
 Cavalry-fort granaries were insufficient for a year's grain, but each cavalryman probably had 3,600 square feet for 480 men. 
 Granary areas varied and some forts appear to have been depots for others. 
 An algorithm provides the possible options for known granaries in terms of the numbers of men and duration of supply.
