The head-vase Paris, Mus√©e du Louvre Inv. 
 Br. 
 2955 is among the most famous Etruscan bronze works, yet it has never been the subject of a stylistic analysis. 
 On the basis of a detailed stylistic and typological examination a dating of the work to the 2nd quarter of the 4th cent. 
 B.C. is proposed.
