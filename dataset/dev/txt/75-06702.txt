Detailed descriptions of the cuirasses worn by Roman emperors and their generals are rarely found in Latin prose. 
 On the other hand, descriptions of the defensive armor worn by Greek, Trojan, and Italian heroes are often found in Latin verse of the Imperial era. 
 Since Latin poets were accustomed to employ elements of their own world in their descriptions of the past, they may well have written about the cuirasses of emperors and their generals in a similar way. 
 Consequently, texts that are rarely used for military studies can provide a contrast to the plastic art of the Empire.
