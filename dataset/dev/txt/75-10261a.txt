According to Constantine (quoted by Eusebius, VC 2, 48-60), the immediate cause for Rome's « Great Persecution » was a Pythian oracle's complaint that Christians were preventing accurate prophecies. 
 Although Constantine's claim is usually conflated with an episode from Lactantius, mort. pers. 10-15, it is probable that Constantine was describing a separate and earlier prophecy from an oracle of Apollo at Daphne near Antioch in A.D. 299. 
 Setting Constantine's oracle in its proper context has significant implications for the history of the early 4th cent.
