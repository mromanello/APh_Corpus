It may be argued that epinician performance is always a communicative act ; that deictic expressions correspond to speech-acts ; and that deictic acts can be described according to their pragmatic uses. 
 Obstacles to our understanding of epinician deixis are, first, related to reference : it is a mistake to attempt to extract from a deictic expression geographical or individual data. 
 The conventional use of deixis, however, does not exclude associated ad hoc references, nor does it impede their communicative efficacy. 
 The two intentions of the poet - a basic orienting intention, corresponding to the speech-act of pointing at a referent, and an arranging, localizing intention, corresponding to the act of giving a place (in space or in time) to that referent - suggest a preoccupation with orienting more than localizing.
