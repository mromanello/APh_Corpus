It is worth examining the usage of the writings of John Cassian as evidenced in Anglo-Saxon sources between the later 7th-mid-8th cents. 
 A.D. Manuscript evidence implies that more than one copy of Cassian's writings was available in Anglo-Saxon England during this period. 
 The usage of Cassian's writings in the Leyden Glossary (= Leyden, Bibl. der Rijksuniversiteit, Voss. Lat. Q. 69), Aldhelm, « De uirginitate », and Bede is clear. 
 The evidence taken as a whole, however, is limited in time to little more than half a century, and to a limited circle of learned contacts.
