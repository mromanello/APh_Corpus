The decoration on a 4th-cent. 
 B.C. Apulian red-figure volute crater (Princeton, Princeton University Art Museum 1989.40) may be related to a revival of Euripides' « Dictys ». 
 The obverse shows Perseus returning with the Gorgon's head, with Danae and Dictys as suppliants, and king Polydectes. 
 Its dramatic inspiration is suggested by the depiction of characters in stage costumes, the « speaking » gesture used by Dictys, the conventional aedicula pattern, and the Dionysiac scene on the reverse. 
 The lack of evidence for Aeschylus' « Polydectes » makes it unlikely to have inspired this vase painting. 
 The altar scene offers evidence for the basic reconstruction of Euripides' plot.
