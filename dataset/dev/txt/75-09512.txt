Some bronze issues in the names of Alexander III and Philip III and assigned to Miletos or Mylasa (Price 2063-2076 and 2077-2134) may have been struck at Kaunos. 
 The bronze coinage of Eupolemos may also have been struck at Kaunos and not at Mylasa. 
 Certain bronze issues of Demetrios Poliorketes from southwest Asia Minor could be attributed to Kaunos. 
 If these attributions are correct, Kaunos becomes a much bigger and less sporadic mint than has hitherto been suspected, active from the late archaic period through the 2nd cent.
