Roman notions of social and legal distinction helped to shape the approach of certain pre-Nicene Fathers to the ordering of the church. 
 The social distinction between « ordo » and « plebs » and the legal one between « honestior » and « humilior » helped these Fathers to differentiate the particular rights and responsibilities of clergy and laity, while the concept of patronage and that of the « paterfamilias » helped them to define the particular role and authority of the bishop. 
 We see this first articulated in Clement and Hermas of Rome, developed further in Tertullian of Carthage, and then find particular expression in Cyprian of Carthage.
