Strabo's history of Judaism (Geog., 16, 2.35ff.), which is most probably copied from Posidonius, focuses less on the past, which is idealized, than on the present which is criticized, as is common in descriptions of a « Golden Age » that later deteriorates. 
 The Posidonian idea of a decline of the Jewish religion made its way into Tacitus' mostly hostile ethnography of Judaism. 
 Modern scholars, especially in the 19th century, when commenting on Posidonius and Tacitus sympathized from a quite different perspective with idea of a Jewish decline.
