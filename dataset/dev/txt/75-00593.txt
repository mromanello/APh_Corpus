The perennial problem in interpreting De anima 3.5 has produced two drastic solutions, one ancient and one contemporary. 
 According to the first, Aristotle in 3.5 identifies the « agent intellect » with the divine intellect. 
 A more recent view holds that the divine intellect is not the subject of 3.5 and that throughout the work Aristotle is analysing the nature of the human intellect. 
 Here it is argued that Aristotle is speaking throughout « De anima » of a unified human intellect, possessing the properties Aristotle explicitly attributes to it. 
 This intellect functions differently when it is and when it is not separate from the hylomorphic composite. 
 It is Aristotle's view that if we were not ideally or essentially intellects, we could not engage in the diverse cognitive activities of this composite.
