In a recent article, D. F. Easton [et al.] (=> 73-10114) state that they share the opinion of Troy excavator M. Korfmann that Troy VI was a large palatial city, a hub for trade, a commercial metropolis or even a center of a Bronze Age federation of cities. 
 In reality, however, they do not defend these views, but offer a more restrained description of the role of Troy VI in the Late Bronze Age. 
 Their arguments can be shown to be untenable due to insufficient evidence. 
 Thus, a thorough criticism of Korfmann's statements (e.g. => 71-09430) remains fully justified.
