As Tibullus' poem now stands, there is a difficulty raised by the fact that a description of a drunk peasant beating his wife after a country fair is joined to an immediately preceding description of the beneficent effects of peace by a « -que » clause (49 f.). 
 In fact, the distich 51 f., which interrupts the poem's flow of ideas, is to be explained as an alternative sketch by Tibullus, already read by Propertius (2, 5, 21-26).
