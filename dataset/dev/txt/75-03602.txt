The early years of Diocletian and Maximian, when the two ruled as joint Augusti, are frequently referred to as a « dyarchy ». 
 Such a term, which is modern and does not represent a formal arrangement of power, is convenient but misleading. 
 Contemporaries preferred instead to employ the more conventional imagery of fraternity and dynasty, within which Diocletian was always represented as the senior ruler. 
 Both kinds of relationship are set out clearly in two panegyrics on Maximian (= nos. 2 and 3 Galletier), the earliest discursive documents of the period.
