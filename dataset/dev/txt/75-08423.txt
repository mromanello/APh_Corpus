The apartment blocks of Ostia, dating from the early reign of Trajan to the middle of the 2nd cent. 
 A.D., have been interpreted as multiple rental units. 
 Within this sample, however, there is a group of larger, more luxurious apartments following a common plan, now called medianum apartments, that clearly belong to the upper end of the market. 
 The common feature is the hall or wide corridor opening onto a court or street, around which the remaining rooms are grouped on three sides. 
 The name is useful, as it identifies these apartments as a coherent group and something potentially quite different than the atrium house familiar from Vitruvius (6, 7, 3 and 6, 3, 8) and the Vesuvian towns. 
 A consideration of the size, organization of space, and design process of these apartments shows that they are a more diverse group in terms of their potential clientele than previously realized.
