In Apuleius, met. 1, 13-14 two witches empty their bladders over Aristomenes, a gesture that has an inhibiting magical function (cf. Petronius 57, 3 and 62, 6), in this instance to prevent Aristomenes from escaping. 
 In the sentence that follows mention of the witches' departure, the phrase « lotio perlitus, quasi recens utero matris editus » underlines the fact that Aristomenes is as helpless as a newborn baby (cf. Cato, agr. 157, 10) while reinforcing the following contrast « immo uero semimortuus, uerum ipse mihi superuiuens et postumus », a conceit for which Apuleius may be indebted to Martial 7, 47, 10.
