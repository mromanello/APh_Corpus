On the association of idolatry with erroneous ideas about the natural world in the writings of late-antique Jewish and Christian authors writing in two polemical genres. 
 The hexaemeral commentaries composed by Philo of Alexandria (« De opificio mundi »), Basil of Caesarea (in a variety of sermons) and Augustine (« De genesi contra manichaeos » and « De genesi ad literam ») positioned the hexaemeron against the background of natural philosophy and used various critiques of idolatry to revise or refute pagan natural philosophy. 
 Heresiology was initiated by Irenaeus (« Aduersus haereses ») and adapted by Augustine to refute Gnostic and Manichaean cosmological myths and disregard for the creation account in Genesis. 
 Prohibitions against idolatry figured in a variety of ways in methodological questions about how to conceptualize the natural world, how to locate the sources of conceptual error, and how to distinguish those errors from truth.
