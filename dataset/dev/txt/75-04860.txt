The themes of tyranny and a ruler's conduct are central in determining the relationship between Seneca's « Thyestes » and the « Octavia ». 
 Correspondences between the plays may be found in structure, as both contain dialogues between the ruler and an interlocutor on principles of rulership (Thy. 204-335 ; Octavia 377-592 and 820-876) ; and in content : the contrast between the ruler and an interlocutor who points to moral values is the same in both. 
 Thus, one can conclude that « Octavia » was not composed independently from « Thyestes ». 
 But the author of « Octavia » has not merely reworked Senecan material in a historical outfit or created a tragedy on the basis of historical figures.
