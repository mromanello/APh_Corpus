Tacitus, ann. 1, 39-44 and Dio 57, 5, 4-7 are not based on different traditions on the end of the Rhine mutiny : they display similarities to one another that indicate that they drew on a common source ; discrepancies in detail and in presentation arise as a result of their different narrative strategies. 
 It is unlikely that Tacitus would have changed his source for a scene within an episode, when narrative strategy is a sufficient explanation of modifications he might choose to make. 
 Suetonius, Calig. 
 9 and 48, 1 also share this common source.
