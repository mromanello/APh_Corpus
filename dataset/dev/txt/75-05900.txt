On the models developed by the communities of Matthew and Thomas for the proper role of the Christian teacher. 
 While the author of Matthew drew on Q 6, 40, and expanded upon this using the figure of Peter, the authors of Thomas offered a different model in direct conversation with Matthew 16 : the model of the Thomas community was that the teacher could supplant and become equal to the master teacher Jesus. 
 Finally, the author of Matthew 23 sought to establish the proper role of teachers using the context of Jewish sectarian controversies, as well as to respond to the model offered by Thomas Christians.
