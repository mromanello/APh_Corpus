At sat. 2, 2, 64 Horace introduces the proverbial opposition of dog and wolf to reflect a choice between squalid degradation and willful rapacity. 
 The « canis » of this line can scarcely fail to call to mind the Avidienus in lines 55-56, known by the nickname « dog », who was himself the embodiment of avarice. 
 The connection between the Lupus of earlier satire (cf. Lucilius, fr. 54 Marx) and the « lupus » of Horace's proverb is then a natural association to make.
