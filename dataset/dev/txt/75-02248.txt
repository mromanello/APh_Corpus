Offers a description, transcription and commentary on part of a literary text, identifiable as Herodotus 9.74-75, preserved in a papyrus fragment from Egypt, now in the Oslo University Library. 
 The neatness of the handwriting and other format details suggest that the fragment originally belonged to a book-roll penned by a professional scribe.
