A narratological analysis of the « Acts of Paul and Thecla » (CANT 211.III = BHG 1710) and the « Acts of Thecla » (BHG 1710 sqq.) shows that men are not depicted as always opposed to Thecla. 
 Paul plays an important role. 
 These considerations alone are not, however, sufficient to serve as an index of female composition. 
 An analysis of Tertullian's Bapt. 17, 4-5 shows that it goes beyond the evidence of his words to say that the presbyter compiled the « Acts of Paul » on the basis of oral legends. 
 Tertullian was aware only of a contemporary woman teacher forbidding baptism, not an entire tradition of women teachers and baptizers.
