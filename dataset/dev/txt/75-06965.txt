Quintilian 11, 3, 65-184 discusses in detail how Roman speakers used gestures involving their arms, hands, and fingers to give force to their words. 
 How Cicero exploited these features remains a matter of speculation. 
 Re-examination is needed of the evidence (de orat. 3, 220 ; orat. 59) concerning Cicero's use of gestures, and how his technique of delivery was related, if at all, to that of later orators. 
 Cicero does not describe all the gestures that he used, largely because he follows the approach to gesture that he found in the existing rhetorical tradition. 
 Quintilian's discussion marks a crucial stage in the development of rhetorical theory. 
 His precepts are best viewed as a catalogue of the gestures used by the orators of his day.
