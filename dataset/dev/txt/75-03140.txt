The only direct statement about the closing of the Athenian Neoplatonic school by Justinian comes from the « Chronicle » of John Malalas (18, 47). 
 The silence of other sources, including those that rely on Malalas, suggests that to contemporaries the event was an unremarkable occurrence that represented neither the tyrannical use of power nor an attack upon the tradition of philosophical teaching. 
 Rather, it occurred within the confines of a political system that, when working properly, matched imperial initiative to the needs of a province or city. 
 As a result, the significance of the closing of the school is best appreciated by understanding how the event developed out of its local political setting.
