Augustus' « Res gestae » documents the augmentation of the religious foundations of his power, through the redefinition of the concept of « auctoritas », and through a vigorous effort to blend civic and religious spaces. 
 The implications of these efforts may be appreciated by comparing « auctoritas » with earlier Republican conceptions of ethos (exemplified by the manner in which Cicero wove his personal ethos into the fabric of his speeches). 
 Such a comparison clarifies how increased control over civil and religious space characteristic of the imperial period accompanied the shift in Roman imperial rhetoric, best understood as a movement toward more epideictic modes of address.
