Lactantius « De mortibus persecutorum » regarded the reign of Diocletian and his co-emperors as a historical turning point because it saw the last major persecution of the Christians who were later to be recognized by Constantine. 
 Modern historians, following the more secular position of Edward Gibbon, acknowledge these years as an important time because of the many substantial reforms initiated by Diocletian, but regard the persecution of the Christians as only one among many events of his reign.
