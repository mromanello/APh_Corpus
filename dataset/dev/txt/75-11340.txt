The fact that Naples was an ethnically-mixed community even before the Roman conquest, and even more so afterward, raises the question how ethnic and cultural identities interacted with each other. 
 Three areas of elite-dominated activity can be used to examine the ways in which different cultural and ethnic identities were constructed within early imperial Naples : literary sources, public inscriptions, and monumental building programs. 
 Regardless of whether the Oscan population still had its own distinctive identity in Augustan Naples, the cultural identity of the city as defined by ancient literature was definitely Greek. 
 The continuing Hellenism of elite self-representation in the official inscriptions until well into the 2nd cent. 
 A.D. and the addition of substantial Romanizing elements to the monumental center of the city seem to be contradictory signals about the identity of Roman Naples and the cultural affiliations of its elite ; these elements, however, simply serve to underline the multi-layered nature of cultural identity in Roman Italy.
