A proposed new model for the voting procedure at the Athenian dramatic competitions, with demonstration of its mathematical viability. 
 Previous proposals (A. W. Pickard-Cambridge => APh 40, p. 338 ; M. Pope => 57-02650 ; E. Caspo and W. J. Slater => 66-05600 ; and P. J. Wilson => 72-07659) have either failed to take full account of the ancient sources or have not considered all the possible permutations of judging results. 
 As is generally recognized, ten votes were cast, but in most circumstances not all were counted. 
 The example studied is the tragic competition at the Dionysia, in which three competitors vied for the prize. 
 Discussion includes : the typical number of lots drawn before a victory is obtained ; how other places are determined ; whether the person who receives the most votes actually wins ; adjudication for comedies and at the Lenaia ; and dithyrambic competitions.
