A demonstrable linguistic continuity from the Bronze Age to the Roman period makes Lycia a particularly useful area in which to study the onomastic habits of the locals. 
 Analysis of Lycia's changing onomastic habits in the Hellenistic and early Roman periods (334 B.C-A.D. 43) casts light on how the inhabitants of a community on the fringes of the Hellenistic world projected particular social identities onto themselves and their children. 
 Sources consist of inscriptions in Greek and in Lycian.
