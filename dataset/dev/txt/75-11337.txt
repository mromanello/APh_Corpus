In the absence of archaeological or epigraphic evidence, most scholars have taken Strabo's short passage on Pleuron (10, 2, 4) as proof that Old Pleuron was sacked by Demetrios II and that, as a result, New Pleuron was rebuilt on higher and more secure ground. 
 Close examination of the historical context and the language of Strabo suggests, however, that Old Pleuron was never sacked. 
 New Pleuron was planned and built from a position of strength as a preventive measure to withstand an anticipated period of warfare. 
 The communities formerly surrounding the low-lying city of Old Pleuron then synoecized around the fortified urban center of New Pleuron.
