Many epinician odes offer deictic indications that point to the places where performance was intended. Study of deixis sheds light upon the range of performance strategies inscribed in the texts and thus offers readers an idea of the pragmatics of performance as well as insight into the possibilities the poets saw as they endeavored to bring together in the space of performance their contemporaries, the heroes of the past, and the gods. Pindar's first Olympian ode represents an exception to his usual practice in that it blurs the boundaries between different spatio-temporal realms. Through deictic devices, the epinician speaker creates the illusion of stepping into mythical time and space, playing, in turn, the roles of Pelops's interlocutor and eyewitness to events that occurred at a remote time.
