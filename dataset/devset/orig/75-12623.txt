Through examination of the figurative language used by Greek artists of the archaic period, representations of old age can be defined by the evolution of certain physical features such as baldness, white hair, a beard, wrinkles, a bent body and the presence of a stick support. Such characteristics can be seen in numerous terracottas and vase-paintings, where it is possible to trace the evolution of these features through time, analyzing their combinations and identifying the figures characterized as old.
