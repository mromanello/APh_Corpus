Philostratus' « Vita Apollonii » is structured by the stylistic distinction between composed and improvisational rhetorics. Philostratus extends this bipolar theory of rhetorical styles to define for Apollonius a religious discourse beyond sophistic rhetoric, marked by silence and oracular speech. The « Vita » represents and evaluates speech in a variety of rhetorical modes and voices, especially those of Apollonius and the narrator. Philostratus' narrative methodically interprets key possibilities of eccentric religious and political speech in the Roman Empire.
