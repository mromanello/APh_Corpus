The references made by Dido on her funeral pyre to « uestis » (Aen. 4, 648) and « exuuiae » (451) point to Apollonius' Hypsipyle as Vergil's model. Hypispyle is consistently associated with gifts of textiles (Apollonius 3, 1204-1206 and 4, 422-430), and those gifts in turn are associated with love-making and betrayal.
