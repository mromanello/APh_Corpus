Middle Minoan architecture helps explain the degree to which the reconstruction of the First Palaces on Crete has been unduly influenced by the model of the Minoan palace as the centralized political, economic and religious authority. The First Palaces differed from their Late Bronze Age counterparts in several important ways, particularly in the absence of so-called « palatial » architectural features thought to form an integral part of the First Palaces (e.g. ashlar masonry, Minoan Hall, Lustral Basin, etc.). The earliest evidence for these architectural features seems to be found in elite residences in settlement contexts ; this observation indicates the need for a reassessment not only of the term « palatial architecture » but also of the nature and location of power of Middle Bronze Age Crete and the role played by architecture as a medium of elite conspicuous consumption. Evidence is considered from Malia, Knossos, and Phaistos.
