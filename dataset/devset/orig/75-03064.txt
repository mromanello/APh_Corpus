In continuation of a previous contribution (=> 70-02969), deals with the second part of Lucretius' account of hearing in DRN 4 (lines 563-614), an exposition on the echo and other acoustic phenomena, e.g. the dispersion of sounds and the fact that sounds pass where eyes cannot see. The interpretational difficulties involved as well as the intellectual (Epicurean and non-Epicurean) background of Lucretius' explanations are discussed. Finally, attention is paid to hitherto unnoticed etymologies, puns and other poetic devices.
