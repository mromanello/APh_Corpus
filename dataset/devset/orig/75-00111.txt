Deixis, the verbal process of pointing toward an extra-linguistic context, is a way of referring to sight. The deictic network of Alcman's « Partheneion » appears to be particularly dense in the opening lines (36-72) of the second part, which is dedicated to the verbal representation of the chorus's performance as it is being held. Optical perception in the « Partheneion » gets dramatized for the audience through these verbal mechanisms, thus turning the ritual into a theatrical event.
