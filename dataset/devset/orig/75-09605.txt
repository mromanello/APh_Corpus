The coinage attributed to Alexandria Troas in the Hellenistic period (first published by A. R. Bellinger => APh 32, p. 323) may be divided into two types : the « autonomous » issues of the civic mint and the « royal » issues produced in the city by the Hellenistic rulers until its incorporation into the Roman province of Asia in 129 B.C. The recent appearance in a private collection of a new autonomous silver issue prompts a reconsideration of the mint's activity in the 4th and 3rd cents. B.C.
