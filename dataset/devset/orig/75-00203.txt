Timomachus' painting of Medea, based on Euripides, Med. 1019-1080 and still knowable through Roman descendants, is a rare example of transmutation from text to image and then again from image to text. The painting of Medea, poised in a moment of indecision, exemplifies the essential qualities of art, its spatial fixity and indeterminacy of meaning. The principal literary texts concerning the painting are a series of ecphrastic epigrams (AP 16, 135-143) in which Timomachus' interpretation of Euripides is mediated by the cultural discourse about Medea begun within Stoic ethical theory. The interrelationship of text and image may be illuminated by showing how the painted image displays discursive meaning and the ecphrastic texts encourage a mental image of the painting in a certain viewing circumstance.
