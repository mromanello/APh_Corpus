According to the ancient commentaries, Il. 21, 195 was omitted by some sources, thereby making Acheloios, instead of Ocean, the origin of all waters, including the sea. The version that omitted line 195 actually represents the earlier textual stage ; much useful information about the lines is supplied by the commentary preserved in P.Oxy. 221. The role of Acheloios is paralleled in the poem interpreted in the Derveni papyrus, and some features of Acheloios' cosmological function, as well as his iconography, have parallels in Akkadian literature. As a cosmic figure, Acheloios was in competition with Ocean, and is only rarely so represented in later preserved texts. His function as the origin of all fresh water and the source of all springs was more persistent, probably due also to his cultic role in Dodona : this, too, is probably reflected in another ancient variant for the text of Il. 16, 234.
