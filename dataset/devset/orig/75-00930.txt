Augustine is a compatibilist in works such as « On the freedom of the will » and « City of God » and right through his final anti-Pelagian writings, and the freedom possessed by the un-fallen and the fallen will is a compatibilist freedom. This leaves Augustine open to the charge that he makes God the ultimate cause of sin.
