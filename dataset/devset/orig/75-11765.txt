Julian (Or. 10 Lacombrade 38, 336 A-B) and Celsus (quoted by Origen, Cels. 3, 59), in putting a law-like pronouncement into the mouths of Jesus and of Christians in general, copied a pattern of speech employed in pagan priestly pronouncements, the only form in which these writers knew such pronouncements to be made. These patterns of speech evidently survived in a stereotyped form beyond the 4th cent. A.D. Priestly pronouncements and sacred laws favored series of asyndetic relative clauses and conditional sentences in which the copula is missing. We may hypothesize the existence of a model, possibly the proclamations made by officials of the Eleusinian Mysteries.
