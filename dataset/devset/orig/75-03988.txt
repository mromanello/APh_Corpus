Plato suggests in the « Gorgias » that we are neither moral calculating machines, devoid of affect, nor mere leaky jars, driven by insatiable desires that may be immune to reason. The right kind of rational discourse may be effective in appealing to one's emotions. This moral psychology of the « Gorgias » does not clash with, but is compatible with, much that is to be found in the « Republic ».
