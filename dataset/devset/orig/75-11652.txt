Analysis of Roman exemplary discourse in surviving texts and other representations reveals the uses to which Romans put exemplary figures. The principal components of such discourse can be schematized as follows : 1) an action held to be consequential for the community, and regarded as embodying crucial social values ; 2) an audience who judge the action within a suitable ethical category, e.g., « uirtus », « pietas », « gratia » ; 3) commemoration of the deed by means of a monument, e.g., narratives, statues, scars, toponyms, cognomina ; and 4) imitation, in that spectators are enjoined to strive to replicate or surpass the deed. The figures of Horatius Cocles (Polybius 54, 4-55, 4 ; Livy 2, 9, 1-2, 10, 11) and Cloelia (Livy 2, 13, 4-11 ; Valerius Maximus 3, 2, 2) admit of especially productive analysis.
