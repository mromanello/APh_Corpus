Two fragments of Cato's « Origines » allow us to reconsider the social function of literature in 2nd-cent.-B.C. Rome. In the first (quoted by Cicero, Tusc. 4, 3), Cato portrays the ancestors in a convivial setting singing the praises of famous men ; in the second (orig. 4, 81) he gestures toward the pontifex maximus' specialized use of writing and the functioning of the « tabula » as a locus of memory. By drawing on the field of performance studies, we can identify the performance features inherent in both fragments and map out how these features inform the positioning of Cato in relation to the identity politics of his time, professionalism, and writing.
