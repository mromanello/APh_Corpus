In this work, Plutarch no longer presents examples of virtuous men to imitate but men « renowned for their vice ». The prologue, which justifies this change of approach, contains allusions to and dialogue with several passages of Plato, and a redefinition of some of Plato's statements about literature ; highlights the need for the reader's own active discrimination in evaluating and responding to the actions and fates of the great men of history ; and invites the reader to approach Demetrios and Antony as tragic heroes.
