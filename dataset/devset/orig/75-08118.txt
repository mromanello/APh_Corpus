In addition to other sites, impressed pottery has been found in Achaea at Agio and Trapeza Hill (in the village of Koumari near Aigio). The characteristic shapes produced by the Impressed Ware workshop are handleless cylindrical and bioconical vases, pyxides, small skyphoi and also models of granaries and possibly tables, tripod legs and human figurines. The recognition and identification of the unique Impressed Ware workshop reflect the skills and productivity of Achaean potters during the Late Geometric period. The study of the products of this workshop has led to the recognition of its Achaean identity and its direct relations with the contemporary Achaean fine painted-ware.
