Interim report of the 2003 excavation of the Roman fort at Yotvata undertaken by the Arvara Institute for Environmental Studies, Florida International University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The fort lies in the southern Arabah about 40 km north of Aqaba. With its roughly square plan and four projecting corner towers, it reflects a type of installation (often termed a « quadriburgium ») common to the eastern frontier in the Later Empire.
