The now standard Anglophone division of the Platonic dialogues into « early », « middle », and « late » should be abandoned. Its main foundations are too weak to support it. The turning-point in the Platonic corpus is not the introduction of « separated » Forms (usually taken as the mark of a « middle », or « mature », dialogue), but rather the shift from one type of moral psychology, or theory of actions, to another, that is, from an « intellectualist » to a « rationalist-irrationalist » psychology, as argued for in Republic IV. This way of dividing the dialogues has greater explanatory power than its rival. If it still gives us a distinction between « Socratic » dialogues and others, this distinction cuts across the standard early/middle division, and it will no longer be describable in terms of « development », if « development » implies philosophical progress
