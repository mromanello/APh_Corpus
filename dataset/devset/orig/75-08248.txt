A marine geophysical survey was conducted at Caesarea Maritima, Israel, to map the buried structure of King Herod's Roman harbor, which was built in 21 B.C. Most of the ruins lie submerged at a depth of 4-10 m below present sea level and cover an area of about 10 ha. Magnetic mapping confirms that concrete structures exposed at several locations on the harbor are part of a more extensive foundation work that underlies the entire mole structure.
