On survey, documentation, and excavation projects carried out at Aphrodisias between 1999 and 2001 by New York University. This report focuses on the stadium and the agora. The stadium was probably built in the 1st cent. A.D., and fieldwork has yielded a better understanding of the south side of the building. Excavation of the north agora focused on following up the results of a geophysical survey of the center of the agora and on the study of the east stoa. New sculptural finds include seven sarcophagi from the SE necropolis and an important late antique portrait head (inv. 00-87). The head has been joined to the large chlamydatus statue (inv. 65-199) identified as the governor Oecumenius, published by K. T. Erim (=> APh 38, p. 492). For previous => 71-09369.
