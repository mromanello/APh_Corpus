In the ancient Near East, the Sun (-god) was frequently regarded as the guardian of justice, the supreme judge. Thus, when Dido declares that the sun does not reject the Tyrian city (« nec tam auersus equos Tyria sol iungit ab urbe »), this is equivalent to asserting that the Tyrians are a just people.
