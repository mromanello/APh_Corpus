Documents of the Republic such as the letters of Cicero exhibit an attitude of command and an assertion of the will, but during the period of Caesar's leadership it is the will of Caesar that becomes important. When the transition to the principate is complete and Ovid is writing his elegies from exile, power relations have changed to such a degree that friendship is conceived in terms of hierarchy and submission.
