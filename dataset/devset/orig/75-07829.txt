In the past, the analysis of small finds, such as coarse wares, faunal and floral remains, and taphonomic records seemed at best incidental to the study of Mithraism, but the growing recognition of the centrality of ritual suggests that it is time to consider these types of evidence. The potential for a full range of detailed artefact- and ecofact-studies, and of a detailed analysis of their contexts, can be well illustrated by the case of the Mithraic temple at Tienen.
