Aristotle, On sense perception, Bks. 3, 6, and 7 explain the nature of light and of the borrowed color of the sea. These need distinguishing from each other and from non-borrowed color. Aristotle also allows imperceptible sounds and changes of pitch, yet denies imperceptible times. The discussion of imperceptible change of pitch is the target attacked in Theophrastus' account of singing (fr. 716 Fortenbaugh, 64-65, l. 108-124). The theory of imperceptible times attacked at Sens. 3, 440a 20-23 and 7, 448a 19-b 16 seems unexpectedly elaborate, and may be a version of one found in the pseudo-Aristotelian « De audibilibus ».
