The story of Saint Anthony's encounter with a fawn in the desert (Jerome, Vita Pauli 8) illustrates a motif common in ecclesiastical historians of the period who sought to portray the debauchery of the urban non-believers in light of the marked alterity of the Christian ascetic on the one hand, and the « noble savage » (the outcast non-believer) on the other. This same theme is found in Philo's « De uita contemplatiua », the account of the Therapeutae in Eusebius' HE 2, 17, and in Sozomen's HE 1, 12. All these works contrast secular social, dietary, and sexual habits with the life of the Christian ascetic through a geographical motif highlighting the alterity of Christian life as compared with secular life.
