Materials and individual tesserae may not have the same aesthetic appeal as mosaic pavement itself, but there is value in examining a large assemblage of loose tesserae from a known site and early context. Analysis of the materials offers a way of linking them with tesserae employed in other mosaics of similar date but from a different location. This then invites the question whether any shared materials can be equated with shared style and design. Examination of the materials also yields evidence concerning the style and patterning of floors that have been destroyed. The present study focuses on Roman Britain in the region largely to the south of the estuaries of the Thames and Severn, where material survives from a wide range of military and civil constructions.
