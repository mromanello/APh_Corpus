A comprehensive consideration of the exploits of Medea represented on Roman sarcophagi that relies on the application of developing techniques of visual analysis and new theories of funerary iconography indicates that Greek mythology was not regarded as merely a set of traditional stories to be used as « exempla », but as an expressive medium in which Roman culture could be explored. 
 Analysis of other visual media and of related literary genres such as eulogy, tragedy (Seneca, « Medea »), letters of consolation (Cicero, Tusc. 3, 76-82 ; Seneca, dial. 6, 20, 4-6), and Ovid's « Heroides » (epist. 12) illuminates the social processes that characterized both the funerary context and Roman society in general. 
 Medea's Corinthian episodes in the visual medium function as an antithesis to Roman funerary ideals, portraying the death of the patron as perfect and transcendent by comparison.
