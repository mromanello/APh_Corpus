Dioscorus' references to the myth of Phaëthon illuminate aspects of the society and sensibility of late antique Egypt. 
 Dioscorus refers to Phaëthon in encomia of petition (9, 3 ; 11, 37-38 ; 15, 1) and an epithalamium (35, 4-5 ; all poems cited according to the numeration of J.-L. Fournet [=> 70-01663]). 
 For Dioscorus' audience the solar figure of Phaëthon is a Christianized figure who moves through his zodiacal course in the fashion exemplified by John Philoponus' exegesis of Psalm 18 : 5 B-7 (Opif. 3, 10-11). 
 Above all, Dioscorus' use of Phaëthon obliquely explores the themes of family, dynasty, inheritance, and legitimacy, since the legend of Phaëthon begins with the query : « Who is my real father ?
