For the transitions between the mythical past and the present in O. 3, Pindar chooses two gestures that highlight the olive tree : the placing of the garland on the head of the athlete (12-14) takes us into the myth of Heracles, who brought the olive tree from the land of the Hyperboreans ; the planting of the tree around the post of the race track (33-34) brings us back to the victor's present. 
 The olive tree comes from a land that is not only temperate but also impervious to the erosive work of time.
