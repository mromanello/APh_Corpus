« Intratextuality » may denote the citation of the text of the « Aeneid » within the text of the « Aeneid ». 
 Citation is a special case of repetition ; what differentiates citation from repetition is its peculiarly textual, literal character. 
 The intratextual trajectory of the opening phrase « arma uirumque » is caught up in the Vergilian obsession with the violent consequences of openings. 
 Episodes of opening within the « Aeneid » (1, 118 ; 2, 268-269 ; 3, 448-452 ; and 7, 601-603) provoke a return to these first words.
