On the removal by Macarius of Egypt of a spell turning a young girl into a horse (Hist. monachorum 21, 17 and Palladius, Hist. mon. 17, 6-9), and its late-antique erotic ritual context. 
 The spell may be seen in the context of a Greek and Roman association of the equine species with lust as exemplified, inter alia, by Ovid, Ars 1, 279-281 and 2, 481-491 ; Apuleius, Met. 7, 21 ; and artistic representations such as a terracotta lamp depicting a woman copulating with a horse (London, British Museum, B.M. 1971.4-26.39, Lamp Q3271).
