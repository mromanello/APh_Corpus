In the first part of the « Parmenides » (to 135 C), Plato seems to have written a radical criticism of his own theory of ideas. 
 In the second part, Plato engages in a logical exercise that neither answers the criticism of the first part, nor delivers a solution to what appear to be insurmountable difficulties. 
 The point of Plato's method is perhaps to dispute a certain claim by displaying its absurd consequences. 
 All possible positions and their logical permutations are delineated, the point being only in the way they are articulated and in the logic of their connection, as each of the positions brings forth some essential trait of the « logic of the signifier ». 
 What is displayed on the way is the message that one is at the same time one and many, that it implies a structure and carries with it alterity.
