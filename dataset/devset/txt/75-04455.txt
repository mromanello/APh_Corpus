Challenges the view that Plotinus identifies matter and evil. 
 Evil is rather the outcome of an incongruent interaction of matter and soul, so that when Plotinus calls matter evil, he does so metonymically denoting matter's totally passive potentiality as perceived by the toiling soul trying to act upon it as a form-bringer. 
 In conclusion, offers a short outlook on the consistency of this interpretation with Plotinus' teaching on the soul and with the further Neoplatonic development of the doctrine of evil.
