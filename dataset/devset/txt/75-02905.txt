Many of Juvenal's satires look back to the reign of Domitian when writers did not enjoy the « libertas » of speaking openly, an essential element of Roman satire. 
 It is thus not surprising that there is a primary tension in Juvenal's poetry between speech and silence, especially with regard to the speaker or the persona who addresses the reader. 
 The programmatic Sat. 1 addresses the issues of speech and silence particularly in its opening (1-21) and closing (147-171) lines, passages that together constitute a diptych full of indications for understanding and interpreting the fifteen diverse satires that follow.
