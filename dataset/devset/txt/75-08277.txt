A summary of the 1995-96 and 2001 excavations and a detailed discussion of the 2002 excavation at Khirbet Qumran, all under the auspices of Bar Ilan University and the Egypt Exploration Society. 
 The 2001 excavations on the slopes west of the compound produced an unanticipated quantity of pottery sherds, as well as 8 bronze coins. 
 In the d√©bris on the W slope, 34 pottery rims were collected. 
 Small finds from these excavations suggest that it is worthwhile to continue searching for collapsed caves in the marl terrace surrounding the main compound. 
 Also, indicators such as pottery and coins can be recovered to help shed light on the history of the site in the Second Temple Period
