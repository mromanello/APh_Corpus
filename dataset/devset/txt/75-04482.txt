Plutarch concludes many episodes of the « De mulierum virtutibus » with an aetiology, a device he uses in a sophisticated manner. 
 The aetiology is Plutarch's main mechanism in the work for proving his argument that men and women can display the same virtue. 
 The aetiologies legitimate his claim by proving that women's actions had real consequences.
