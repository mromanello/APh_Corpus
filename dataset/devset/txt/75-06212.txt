The modern philosophical distinction between « reactive » and « objective » emotional attitudes can help us define different types of attitude that we find analyzed in ancient philosophy and portrayed in literature ; in particular, it can help us correlate the responses presented in Vergil's « Aeneid » with those promoted by philosophical movements of his day. 
 Stoicism and, to an extent, Epicureanism advocate the adoption of an « objective » or dispassionate attitude toward other people. 
 In the Aristotelianism familiar in the late Republic and early Empire, by contrast, the « reactive » attitude, in which the other person is treated as a fully responsible agent and liable for praise or blame on that basis, is assumed to be valid. 
 There is thus a rich intellectual background against which to locate the attitudes we find in the « Aeneid » (4, 305-308 ; 8, 536-540 ; 11, 178-181 ; 12, 919-952).
