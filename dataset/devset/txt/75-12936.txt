Four 2nd- to 3rd-cent.-A.D. pavements from houses in or around Antioch on the Orontes are recognized to have had some association with the theater. 
 The « Red Pavement » (Hatay Museum, Antakya no. 1018) and the mosaic of « Iphigeneia » (Hatay Museum no. 961) may illustrate particular plays of Euripides ; scenes in the « House of Dionysus and Ariadne » (Hatay Museum no. 945c) show satyrs in theatrical costume ; and a triclinium mosaic from the « House of Menander » (Princeton [N.J.], Princeton University Art Museum 40.435) portrays Menander himself. 
 Analysis of these images provides evidence of the cultural life of Antioch and of the interests of elite patrons.
