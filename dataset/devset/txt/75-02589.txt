H. Frölich, « Die Militärmedicin Homer's » (Stuttgart, 1879) summarized all the wounds Homer described in terms of weapon, site of wound, and result. 
 There are three reasons for reconstructing Frölich's table : 1) Frölich's data may not be entirely correct ; 2) Frölich does not distinguish between the throwing spear (javelin) and the thrusting spear (spear) ; 3) re-examination of the subject provides an opportunity to consider how, in the context of fatal and non-fatal wounds, Homer signifies death and survival. 
 Analysis of spear wounds turns up anomalies in the description of the wound that killed Hector, which may perhaps be accounted for by the special nature of the Pelian ash spear of Achilles (16, 143 ; 20, 259 and 277 ; 21, 162 and 169 ; 22, 328) and the special powers of the hero.
