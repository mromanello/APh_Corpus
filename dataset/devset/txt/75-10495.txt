Since evidence is scarce on the direct administration of Cyrenaica by the Ptolemies between 321 and 96 B.C., the study of the royal cult and the relations between the Ptolemies and traditional cults of the city provides valuable insight on the nature of the dialogue between the king and the cities. 
 It is clear from the available evidence that cult structures already existing in Egypt strongly included Cyrenaica in the Ptolemaic space. 
 But the participation of the city in the royal cult and the flexibility of the royal language of power show that imperialistic views fail to explain fully either the longevity of Ptolemaic power in Cyrenaica or the necessity for the Ptolemies to legitimize their power even in a territory under direct administration.
