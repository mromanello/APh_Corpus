Aristotle, Cael. 1, 2, 268 B 14-287 A 12 accounted for the dynamics of the cosmos in terms of the tendencies of the various elements to distinct types of natural motion, and (in the case of the sublunary elements) their tendences to rest in their natural places. 
 In so doing, he introduced a fifth element, the ether, as the matter for the heavenly bodies. 
 The conceptual underpinnings of this model were set in place by Xenarchus of Seleucia ; later philosophers (in particular Simplicius, in Cael. 1, 2, quoting Alexander of Aphrodisias) attempted to rebut these objections.
