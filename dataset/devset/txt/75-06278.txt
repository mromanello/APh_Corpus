The sermon « de laude sanctorum » by Victricius of Rouen may be interpreted as an attempt at cultural translation. 
 In the sermon Victricius welcomes to Rouen a gift of relics from Ambrose. 
 Victricius deploys a late-antique education in rhetoric and philosophy to make relic cult and asceticism acceptable. 
 Equating corporeal relics with the presence of God, he uses the « aduentus », the ceremonial reception of a visiting emperor or his deputy by local aristocracy, as an analogy for the reception of relics by ascetics and clergy.
