In his « Life » of Solon, Plutarch comments on particularities of the language used by the statesman in his legislative activity : euphemisms, introduction of new technical terms, change in the meanings of older words, and preference for Attic vocabulary. 
 Analysis of these particularities illustrates how Solon made a great effort of adaptation to the new historical, social and political circumstances, and tried to facilitate the citizens' assimilation of the new legal framework.
