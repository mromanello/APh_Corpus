The legend recounted in Testament of Abraham 6, 5 is clearly inspired by Ge. 
 18, 8, where the subject of the second clause (and it/he stood/rose up) is ambiguous between Abraham and the sacrificed calf. 
 The legend of the Testament is clearly dependent upon the Hebrew text of Genesis, because the same ambiguity does not arise in the Greek text of the LXX. 
 The Testament borrows freely from Greco-Roman mythology and, hence, does not exalt Judaism over its pagan rivals.
