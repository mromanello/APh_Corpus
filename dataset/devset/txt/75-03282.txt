Analysis of Menander's exploitation of the device of « speaking back » to people indoors in the « Dyskolos » (e.g., at 206-211) shows that this device is not confined to realistic entrances or to providing a means of informing the audience of backstage developments. 
 By using the protagonist's body and head posture (slightly turned back) as he emerges, throwing back remarks to those inside, Menander creates situations and plot-movements that play on the audience's expectations in a dramatic way. 
 The economy of speech, the urgency, and the casual manner of appearance allow swift plot development. 
 All in all, the device is an effective means of characterization.
