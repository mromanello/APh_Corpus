At R. 462 A-E, Plato provides an account of political unity summarized in the following claims : 1) Political unity is the sharing of pleasures and pains in common ; 2) The unity of a polis resembles the unity of an individual ; 3) Political unity is the greatest good for a polis. 
 Aristotle, Pol. 1261 A criticizes the coherence of these claims, arguing that if anything becomes completely unified it becomes an individual and ceases to be a state. 
 Since the greatest good for a city preserves it, a city cannot be unified as an individual is unified. 
 R. Mayhew (=> 69-00538) has rightly defended the philosophical significance of Aristotle's objections. 
 Reconstruction of the Platonic view shows that a more careful reading avoids the Aristotelian criticisms, and that Aristotle endorses the reconstructed view.
