Although Greek poleis were vulnerable to ecologically- and socially-induced stress and catastrophe, the phenomenon of polis-desertion in the late Classical and early Hellenistic periods says a great deal about their resilience. 
 The institutionalization of intercommunal relationships, such as kinship, sympoliteia, isopoliteia and, particularly, koinon, enabled cities to deal with the pressures of stress and catastrophe. 
 Case studies serve to illustrate, although not comprehensively, that socially-constructed responses to pressures that catalyzed the abandonment of poleis occurred primarily at the institutional level. 
 On the other hand, complete abandonment may not be a necessary requirement for resilience. 
 The abandonment of a single settlement must always be understood as a part of a larger process of population mobility and resource distribution.
