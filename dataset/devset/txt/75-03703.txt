Only a close scrutiny of the « Periegesis » together with other sources for the activities of ancient travellers allow insight into the process that led to Pausanias' published work. 
 Internal references show that Pausanias wrote between the 150s and ca. 
 A.D. 180. 
 The « Periegesis » represents a meandering route through Greece that does not reproduce an actual itinerary. 
 Pausanias developed a geographical ordering that avoided repetition and was easy to remember. 
 The work reflects a traveller's view of geography : although links among regions reveal Pausanias' grasp of the Greek landscape, adjacent geographical features are often not connected if they are not along the same route. 
 Pausanias focused on sacred buildings, statues, and memorials that he considered « worth seeing » even if they were damaged, and regardless of their aesthetic appeal. 
 His insistence on autopsy makes his work valuable.
