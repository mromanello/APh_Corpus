In the history of political thought, the idea that men are equal is usually discussed in the context of the advent of democratic rule in the Greek polis, that is, in a situation in which the demos is already constituted as a political actor. 
 To constitute itself politically, however, the demos must already command a language in which the claim of equality can be expressed. 
 Examination of the Thersites episode in Il. 2, 225-238 shows how we may retrieve the origins of that language, the historical moment when equality became thinkable in a setting in which the politicized demos had not yet appeared.
