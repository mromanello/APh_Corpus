Callimachus' « Hymns » make constant, though often oblique and amusing, reference to the rhapsodic « Homeric hymns ». 
 This allusion is particularly extensive in the « Hymn to Artemis », which proceeds like most longer « Homeric hymns » with brief introduction and prolonged narration. 
 Just as the hymn seems to end, it begins anew (Dian. 110-112), not once but over and over again ; this transition, introduced by invocation to a god or goddess, is based on h.Ap. 
 140-142. 
 The choice of the « Hymn to Apollo » as model reflects the theme of sibling rivalry that pervades the « Hymn to Artemis ».
