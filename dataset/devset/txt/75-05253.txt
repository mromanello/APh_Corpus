The prologue of Tacitus' « Agricola » is at pains to maintain for the work the option to be either important or inconsequential. 
 The goal of this effort is to anticipate a spectrum of possible receptions : if the work is welcomed by its audiences, it can serve as the first step in a prestigious literary career ; if it meets with indifference, Tacitus' already-existing social self can find protection behind the claims to limited importance. 
 Analysis of the relationship of « Agricola » to Sallust's monographs, and comparison with Pliny's career as a Catullan poet, show that Tacitus' claims to write after the manner of a canonical author directly serve the aim of keeping options open.
