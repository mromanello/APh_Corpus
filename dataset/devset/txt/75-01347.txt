Because the « Verrines » contain both speeches delivered and those of the « actio secunda » that were not, the corpus invites consideration of the question of the relationship between delivered and circulated versions of the speeches. 
 Three points may be argued : 1) Proceeding from the trial's chronology, one may claim that the « actio secunda » would have been largely composed before the proceedings ended. 
 2) The form and techniques of the « actio secunda » orations are similar to other Ciceronian speeches that were delivered. 
 3) Cicero put the Verrine corpus into circulation for the traditional reason, self-promotion. 
 This last argument runs counter to thought-provoking claims that Cicero circulated the « actio secunda » out of discomfort over his unusual manoeuvers during the « actio prima »
