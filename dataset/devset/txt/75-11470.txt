Survey work has been conducted by the University of Ghent since 2000 in the central Italian region of Marche. 
 The study has aimed to explore the changes in the landscape and occupation patterns in the period c. 1000 B.C.-A.D. 
 1000 throughout the Potenza river valley. 
 The survey yielded some striking results relating to the evolution of concentrated human settlement toward an urban society with greater social complexity and to the subsequent breakdown of this urban pattern. 
 During the Piceni Iron Age (9th to early 3rd cent. B.C.) there is a pattern of grouped settlement controlling large areas. 
 The transitional 3rd and early 2nd cent. 
 B.C. is less clear in the archaeological record, but the military victory over Picenum in 268 B.C. had far-reaching consequences for maritime areas selected as colonies. 
 The interior did not change until the second phase of Roman urbanization in the early 1st cent. 
 B.C. The three interior towns show a similar system of urban layout, and although the success of these towns in the early imperial period is clear, it is difficult to assess what happened to the urban network in late antiquity. 
 Invasions and economic and demographic decline caused a gradual abandonment of urban centers and large tracts of countryside.
