Evidence for the manufacture of ferrous armor, which was used alongside that manufactured from copper alloy throughout the early empire. 
 Metallographic analysis of polished sections of pieces of ferrous armor enabled the composition of the material to be established. 
 The samples range from the 1st to the early 3rd cents.
