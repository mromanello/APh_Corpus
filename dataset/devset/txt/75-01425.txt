Examines how Clement appropriates the Philonic doctrine of the divine powers. 
 The biblical basis of the doctrine, in which Pauline influence is superimposed on Genesis is first examined, then the subject is treated successively in the areas of theology, cosmology and the doctrine of creation, including the creation of humanity. 
 For Clement, experience of the divine power (usually in the singular) leads to knowledge of God (to the extent possible) and intimacy with him through the Son. 
 Clement's Philonic heritage has enabled him to develop a positive and above all a dynamic theology.
