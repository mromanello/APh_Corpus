The basic details of the portrayal by the sources of the episcopate of John Chrysostom have long been accepted in the literature. 
 So also the perspective from which his episcopate is viewed, which is both Constantinopolitan and partisan. 
 When events are examined from a different angle, that of Antioch, it can be seen that the standard portrayal needs to be treated with caution. 
 An Antiochene perspective offers insight into events as they unfolded, specifically, John's nomination and election ; the alliance of Epiphanius of Salamis with John's enemies ; John's conflicts in Constantinople compared with his experience in Antioch.
