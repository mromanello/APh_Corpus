The verbal similarities between Tacitus and Q. Curtius Rufus cannot be fortuitous. 
 Tacitus had portions of Curtius at his fingertips, the speeches especially, and he sharpened their rhetorical context. 
 The allusions to Alexander add depth to Tacitus' history : the immoderately moderate Agricola becomes an Alexander without « temeritas » (cp. Agr. 30-34 with Curtius 4, 14, 1-26) ; while the malevolent, secretive Domitian has the ruthlessness and duplicity of Alexander without his courage and strategic virtuosity (cp. Agr. 2, 3 with Curtius 10, 2, 30-10, 3, 4). 
 Curtius is only one of a multiplicity of literary foils used by Tacitus.
