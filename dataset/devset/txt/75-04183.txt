The current scholarly consensus (most recently C. Bobonich => 74-04780) depicts Plato as having renounced the political ideal of his « Republic » and modified it in favor of a « mixed constitution » in the « Laws ». 
 A close reading of passages indicates that Plato's critique of democracy remains as firm in the « Laws » as it was in the « Republic » and the « Statesman », refusing to concede any room to any form of popular sovereignty that could threaten the government of knowledge.
