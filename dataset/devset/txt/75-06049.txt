Pericles' praise of the Athenian constitution presupposes a complex audience, some of whom are reluctant to hear his praise. 
 Part of the resistance arises from doubts about the negative freedom of the private citizen (2, 37, 2-3). 
 But it also concerns the positive freedom of all citizens to participate equally in political life (2, 37, 1). 
 Pericles attempts to overcome audience resistance by frankly acknowledging its source - « the equal share » and its allegedly unfair consequences for the rich - and by showing why the principle does not entail class domination. 
 All citizens and classes share in governance, without sectarian injustice.
