Though the philosophical interpretations of Servius mostly reflect prevailing Neoplatonic doctrines, instances of Stoic and Epicurean exegesis can be detected. 
 According to Cornutus, the original Stoic myth had been disfigured by poetry, which altered it to suit literary purposes. 
 Cornutus's antagonistic attitude toward Vergil is consistent with this idea : by introducing inventions into the myth, Vergil moved farther away from the original wisdom contained therein. 
 Although the Vergilian scholiasts were acquainted with Cornutus's comments, they did not detect their philosophical foundations. 
 Seneca's Stoicism was less dogmatic than that of Cornutus ; his influence on the scholiasts was negligible.
