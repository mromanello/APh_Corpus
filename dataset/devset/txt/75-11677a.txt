The black-skinned demon of early Christian monastic literature was born from the association of blackness with sin and evil that was common in numerous varieties of ancient Mediterranean religious discourse, but it became Ethiopian (and not merely black) in Egypt. 
 Egyptians, their own dark skin commending them to others as symbols for the demonic, turned to their proximate other, the Ethiopian, to do the same. 
 The stereotypical hypersexuality of the Ethiopian provided a secure and clearly marked alterity by which monks could, through exteriorization, clarify their identities as good monastic sons or fathers at moments of crisis. 
 But this crystallization of identity that the Ethiopian demon facilitated was disturbed by an Ethiopian such as St. Moses the Black : his exemplary humility was the object of ascetic desire, but his black skin continued to mark him as the self that must be renounced. 
 Texts discussed include Athanasius' « Life of Antony », Didymus the Blind's « Commentary on Zechariah », Cassian's « Conferences », the « Historia monachorum », and the « Apophthegmata Patrum ».
