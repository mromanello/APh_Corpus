On the presence of literary artifacts of material legal culture in comedy. 
 It is unusual for legal documents to provide a mechanism of identification in New Comedy, but one such document appears in Menander, Sic. 130-149. 
 Letters are the most frequent type of literary documents found in Plautus ; all appear in plays of intrigue rather than in plays of identification. 
 The one certain example of a written contract in Plautus, the contract for hiring a prostitute in Asin. 746-748, is much like a letter.
