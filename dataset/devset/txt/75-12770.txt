The rather exceptional output of the Laconian bronze industry between 650 and 550 adds up to more than sixty hydriae, complete or fragmentary. 
 They can be organized into two groups : with female protomes (Telestas and Gitiadas hydriae and their forerunners) ; with other decorations (with show handles, duck head, or palmettes). 
 The long-standing controversy about the dating of the well-preserved group from Paestum and Sala Consilina can be ended by incorporating these hydriae into the Gitiadas group (2nd quarter of the 6th cent.).
