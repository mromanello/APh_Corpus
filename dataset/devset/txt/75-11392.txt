Beginning from the Late Bronze Age, links between the Aegean world and the North African coast remained unbroken except perhaps for an interlude after the foundation of the Phoenician colonies between the Gulf of Syrte and what is now Tunisia. 
 The example of Cyrene is one of the most clear-cut. 
 Even though the paucity of finds and their provenance from infill call for caution, reanalysis of the archaeological record sheds light on the Phoenician colonial process. 
 The reanalysis should not be restricted by conventional chronology, and should encourage us to reconsider other accepted ideas about the growth of the original settlement and the links between the Battiad royal family and other members of the Cyrenaican community.
