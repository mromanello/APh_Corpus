On the colonial forum and its potential use as a political space. 
 At Fregellae (328 B.C.), Alba Fucens (303 B.C.), Cosa and Paestum (273 B.C.) rows of pits have been discovered bordering the forum, which have been interpreted as part of the ritual or practical settings for popular assemblies.

 Nevertheless, the pit structures as a whole are too diverse to fit this model, which in turn raises the question whether any single theory will ever be able to accommodate all aspects of the material.
