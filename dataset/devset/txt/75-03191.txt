Martial's « Epigrammaton libri » have been described as a receptacle for previously-published poems or groups of poems. 
 Examination of themes in Book 4, however, reveals that there are different types of connection between individual poems and cycles, and that the inner cohesion in Martial's work is more pronounced than has been supposed. 
 Furthermore, the book context of each epigram can imply metapoetic statements and thus influences the reader's reception of the poem. 
 Given the close-knit web that spans Book 4, it seems unlikely that the 89 epigrams ever appeared anywhere other than together in this book.
