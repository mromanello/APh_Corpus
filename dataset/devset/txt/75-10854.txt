The romantic notion that barbarian peoples organized themselves around internal identities that persisted essentially unchanged over centuries should be challenged. 
 The Alemanni comprised an amalgam of consituent groups whose identities and behavior fluctuated according to situation and context. 
 This loose organization of groups was transformed into a more cohesively-organized gentile configuration during the migration period, when Alemannic and Suebic elements formed a common Alemannic identity. 
 Contemporary sources include Ammianus Marcellinus 16, 12 ; Iordanes, Get. 281 ; and others.
