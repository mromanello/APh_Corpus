The function of comedy within the « Pro Caelio » should be reassessed. 
 At issue is Cicero's ability to make the jury study the issues in the case as if they were watching a comedy, and to appeal to their understanding of the rules of the genre. 
 The relationship between comic morality and the « locus » as a unit of rhetorical argumentation should also be reconsidered, since a passage such as Cael. 39-42 may as aptly be described as a rhetorical « locus de indulgentia » as analyzed in terms of the laws of comedy. 
 It can be argued that not just the characters of drama but also the speakers in the forum were accustomed to rehearse and deliver formal rhetorical « loci » even in the culture of Plautine Rome.
