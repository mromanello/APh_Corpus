In the famous « battle of images » between Mark Antony and Octavian in the build-up to Actium the figures of Hercules and Omphale are often assumed to have served Octavian's anti-propaganda, displaying the triumuir as emasculated by the Egyptian queen. 
 However the link between Hercules and Antony was tenuous, especially in his later career, and there is little evidence that the mythological scene had propagandistic connotations. 
 Thus a political reading of the images is stretching the evidence too far.
