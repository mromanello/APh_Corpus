The oracle story in Plato, Ap. 17 B-20 D explains Socrates' commitment to philosophy as a religious mission. 
 The god wanted to make use of Socrates' reputation for wisdom and to hold him up as a standard by which all others should judge themselves. 
 He also wanted others to come to a realization that they were not wise in just the way that Socrates had come to this realization, that is, by a rational process of self-examination.
