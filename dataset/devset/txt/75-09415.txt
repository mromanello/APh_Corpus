The coh. 
 II Tungrorum stationed in Britain bears the unique title of « C.L. » on several inscriptions. 
 The traditional expansion is « ciuium Latinorum » which, on the analogy of the common « C.R. 
 », implies that the unit received a grant of Latin status (rather than Roman citizenship). 
 Such a grant could have been made by Trajan when he was on the Rhine and when he apparently raised the civitas of the Tungrians (Tongres) to the status of a municipium (with Latin status).
