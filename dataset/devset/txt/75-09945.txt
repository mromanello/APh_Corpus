The inscription on a statue base found in the Agora Excavations (I 7483) provides information from the late 2nd and early 3rd cent. 
 A.D. on intermarriage between the families of the Eumolpidai and Kerykes. 
 It also makes it possible to identify members of the Casiani (of Steiria, of the genos of Eumolpidai) with Eleusinian priests whose names have hitherto been known only in their hieronymous form. 
 It is also evident that the Claudii of Melite (of the genos of Kerykes) claim descent from Pericles.
