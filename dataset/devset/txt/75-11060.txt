A comprehensive quantitative model of population transfers within, to, and from Italy from the late 4th cent. 
 B.C. to the 1st cent. 
 A.D. Analysis of the demographic context, scale, and distribution of the migration of free persons leads to the following conclusions : 1) that the total population of Italy in the early imperial period was 5-6 million ; 2) that state-sponsored resettlement programs increased levels of mobility during the Italian wars in the late 4th-early 3rd cents. 
 B.C., in the aftermath of the Second Punic War, and in the period of constitutional transition from the 80s to the 10s B.C. ; and 3) that in the last two cents. 
 B.C., colonization programs and growth in Italy required the permanent relocation of two to two and a half million adults. 
 High levels of human mobility were both a direct function of empire-building and a defining feature of Roman identity.
