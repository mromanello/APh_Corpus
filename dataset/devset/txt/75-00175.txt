The miraculous death of Amphilochius at Ammianus 21, 6, 3 should be interpreted as an omen pointing to the future, rather than the fulfillment of Constantius' prophetic statement the previous day. 
 The reason Constantius rejoiced at the death was that he interpreted it as a sign that Julian would die without his having to effect this. 
 As it happened, it was Constantius II himself who died. 
 Ammianus intended the anecdote to contrast Constantius' foolishness in rejoicing at an omen that he had misunderstood with the success displayed by Julian in interpreting such signs.
