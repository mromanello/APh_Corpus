Cato's words « Carthago delenda est » cannot be understood within the context of their own time : the statement can only make sense from the perspective « Carthago deleta est ». 
 Representations of Cato's demand (e.g., by Pliny, nat. 15, 74-75 and Plutarch, Cat. Ma. 54, 1-2) minimize the gap between Cato's words and the completion of the deed, noticeably bypassing the Senate's first response to the debate, in which they decided not to destroy Carthage but to relocate it (Polybius 3, 20, 6). 
 Cato's insistence on the necessity of destruction is a seeming necessity that arises out of subsequent recognition : we see the destruction of Carthage as completed, and retroject into the 2nd cent. 
 B.C. the necessity of this destruction. 
 Cato appears as a miraculous figure whose words do not represent actions in the past but create a future within which actions seem inevitable.
