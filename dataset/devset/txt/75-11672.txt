The first centuries B.C. and A.D. see the adoption and spread of new ways of disposing of the dead in southeast Britain both prior to and following the Roman conquest. 
 Cremation was not a novelty of these mortuary practices as much as the widespread choice of interring the cremated remains with or within ceramic vessels. 
 The adoption of cremated burial with ceramic containers is not a practical response to cremation, but a cultural and social choice made by mourners in order to commemorate the dead in a particular way. 
 The different uses of ceramics in early Roman cremation rites may be understood as ways of selectively remembering and forgetting the dead and the past. 
 In addition, food and drink were consumed by the living and placed with the dead to create memories and sustain relationships between the living and the dead. 
 The consumption of food and drink provided an appropriate metaphor for disposing of the dead.
