Results of the University of Cologne/University of Bamberg 2002 epigraphical campaign of Pednelissus in Pisidia, southern Turkey. 
 This campaign led to the revision of 21 texts as well as the discovery of five new inscriptions, all of them in Greek. 
 The majority of these texts are building and honorary inscriptions and, with one possibly Hellenistic exception, they date from the Roman imperial times.
