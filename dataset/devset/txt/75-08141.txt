The results of the geoarchaeological investigations by the British School at Athens at the Canal of Xerxes in Northern Greece show that there was a canal across the Athos Peninsula and not a slipway. 
 The canal's features conform to those outlined by Herodotus (Hist. 7, 22-24 ; 7, 37 ; 7, 122) in his descriptions of the structure built by Xerxes to allow the Persian fleet into the Aegean for the invasion of Greece in 480 B.C.
