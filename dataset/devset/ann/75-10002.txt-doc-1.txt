Greek women had many active roles in warfare.
Women were paramount in securing food and arms both at home (Plutarch, Pyrrh. 27, 4 ; Polyaenus 8, 49) and away.
Women took up arms or roof tiles (Pausanias 4, 29, 5) to protect their communities against invaders.
Women 's bravery is evident in the many cases of mass suicide committed to preserve the reputation of their cities and themselves (Plutarch, Moralia 244 ; Diodorus 25, 15).
Their presence among camp followers as prostitutes and entertainers also had real value.
