Madness presents Herakles/Hercules in an unprecedented state of extreme vulnerability and becomes an apt device for dramatizing the fragility of life and the responses to tragic reversals of fortune.
Here the dramatic treatments of this theme by Euripides and Seneca are compared not in terms of a strict adaptation of a source/model, but in terms of the dramatic purposes underlying and determining both similarities and differences.
The connotations of madness are investigated, and the ways in which the associations of themes such as the reversal of fortune, the nature of violence or the political overtones may have guided the reception of each drama by a Greek and a Roman audience respectively are explored
