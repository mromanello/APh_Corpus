Two groups of forgeries have been identified whose common features suggest that one or both may have been products of the same forger as the Rhodian drachm discussed by S. Ireland (=> 75-09584).
These 10 bronze and silver pieces, located in various collections, copy Chian silver drachms.
Two other probable Chian forgeries are also discussed.
