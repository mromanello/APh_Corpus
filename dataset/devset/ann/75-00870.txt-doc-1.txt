To the extent that time is by its very structure a sign of eternity in Augustine 's « Confessions », it is necessary not only to analyze how man 's subjective construction of time functions in relation to his assessment of eternity, but also to consider Augustine 's understanding of time in terms of creation, as well as his understanding of God 's relation to that time.
We are then in a position to see how man, as « imago Dei », repeats on his own personal level God 's relationship to temporality and history, and to see how this repetition stimulates the turning of man toward God.
