The so-called « tomb of a rich Athenian lady » was excavated near the Athenian Agora in 1967 by E. L. Smithson (=> APh 39, p. 405 and 483).
Recent reexamination of the cremated remains in the tomb has brought to light the presence of a fetus four to eight weeks short of full term and established that the adult female died during pregnancy or premature childbirth.
The physical anthropology of mother and child is reviewed and a facial reconstruction of the deceased woman presented.
