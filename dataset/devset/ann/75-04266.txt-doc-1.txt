According to the accounts of Socrates in Plato 's « Apology », « Hippias major », « Lysis », « Charmides », and « Meno », Socrates ' mission was to seek the highest knowledge available to humans.
Knowledge of virtue itself is available only to the gods.
The highest knowledge that humans can attain is knowledge of moral ignorance.
This knowledge can fade with time, so constant self-examination is necessary.
