Ovid uses the story of the « hasta Romuli » in met. 15, 552-612 to inform our reading of the Cipus story to which it is juxtaposed.
The challenge Cipus faces, namely, to avoid kingship, constitutes not a moral dilemma but an historical dilemma.
At issue is not whether Cipus should avoid being king, but whether anyone at Rome can avoid the legacy of kingship that Romulus left to the city by his foundational act.
