Surveys the history and development of Greek nominal paradigms, from Mycenaean Greek up to the present.
Two major changes over this time span contributed to reshape nominal paradigms : case syncretism, which had the effect of reducing the number of cases, and the elimination of so-called athematic declension, which resulted in the reduction of the number of inflectional classes and the redistribution of nouns between the remaining classes.
Both developments can be better understood in terms of the spread of stable and superstable markers, together with with ongoing elimination of markers with low token frequency
