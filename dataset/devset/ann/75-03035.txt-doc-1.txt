Lucian, Symp. 48 ends with a citation of Euripides (Alc. 1159-1163 ; Andr. 1284-1288 ; Hel. 1688-1692 ; Ba. 1388-1392).
Examination of the function and the effect of the verses as a conclusion to Lucian 's nondramatic prose work illuminates Lucian 's parodic technique, his use of well-known literary works for his own ends, and his attitude toward the philosophers of his time.
Euripides ' verses on the fickleness of the gods and the unpredictability of life were known up to Lucian 's time and later for their content and also as a mark of the ending.
