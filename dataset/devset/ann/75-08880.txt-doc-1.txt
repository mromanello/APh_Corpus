Evidence for Near Eastern influence in 7th-cent.
Etruria includes religious beliefs and practices, clothing and hairstyles, dining habits, technologies, and tomb design and burial.
The recognition of a Near Eastern ethnic element among the Etruscan elite means that they were a fluid and complex society, rather than an entirely autochthonous people who absorbed or borrowed outside influences through traded goods or occasional immigrant craftspeople.
