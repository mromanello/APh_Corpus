Roman culture was re-invented during the last decades of the 1st cent.
B. C., becoming a culture that was meaningful for people throughout Italy and the provinces and a mark of major achievement for this period.
The absence of Roman culture during the Republican period should not be regarded as a result of local resistence ; rather, it reflects the people 's perception of Roman culture vis-Ã -vis Greek culture.
Only gradually did Romanness acquire values to which an increasing number of people throughout the empire could relate.
