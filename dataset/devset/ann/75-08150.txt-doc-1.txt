The original function of the synagogue on Delos has long been contested and can be determined only through analysis of the architectural history of the building.
Five phases of construction are distinguished : two predate 88 B. C. and the remaining three date between 88 and the end of the 2nd cent.
A. D. The structure 's most characteristic features - a large hall, a water reservoir, orientation toward the east, and an isolated location on the eastern shore - are not consistent with those of a private house, a meeting place for an association, or a pagan cult-building, but rather confirm its function as a synagogue from the earliest phase onward.
