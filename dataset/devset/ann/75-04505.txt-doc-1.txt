The tale of the riddle-contest between the Pharaoh Amasis and the king of Ethiopia (Plut. sept. sapient. conu. 151A-E) was based on an Egyptian story about a contest of wits between Amasis and the king of Kush.
The Egyptian story was taken over by Greek narrators, who incorporated it into the cycle of the Seven Sages, casting Bias in the role of Amasis ' consultant.
The twofold pattern of an initial, testing problem as a preliminary for a more serious contest of wits occurs in many stories, both in the Greek and in other traditions.
An appendix examines various types of riddles and problems occurring in these stories (« adynaton », riddle of the superlative, simile-riddle, games based on a climactic sequence, the relation of oracles and omens with riddles)
