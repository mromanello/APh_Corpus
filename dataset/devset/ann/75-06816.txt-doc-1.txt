The ways in which asides are used in New Comedy and in the Palliata are worlds apart.
Although Roman poets do use some techniques occurring in New Comedy, Greek models do not offer any instances that employ asides in the excessive and comic manner of Plautus (e. g., Amph. 176-179 ; 423-426 ; 463-465).
