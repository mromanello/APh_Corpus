On some of the ways in which Dionysius exploits the poetry of the 3rd cent.
BC.
After Homer, the most important poet for Dionysius is Apollonius whose « Argonautica » offers a model for journeying around the world and for the poetic exposition of geography.
Dionysius also uses Hellenistic traditions of didactic poetry, yet the voice of Callimachus in the « Aitia » may have been the principal influence on the tone of the « Periegesis ».
Dionysius ' use of these traditions is an excellent example of how hexameter « didactic » poets found a place for themselves against the claims of learned prose.
