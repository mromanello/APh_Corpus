When Vespasian took the throne in A. D. 69, he was faced with the challenge of setting up a program of recovery after the civil war ; the degree of his perceived success is evident from the praise accorded to him by Tacitus (Hist. 1, 50, 4).
Two major monuments in Britain merit consideration with regard to the new regime 's intent to establish auctoritas : the Temple of Diuus Claudius at Colchester and the Monument at Richborough.
Although the building program of the Temple of Claudius began before the reign of Vespasian, its completion under his reign would have contributed to Vespasian 's auctoritas in Britain.
On the other hand, although Vespasian is likely to have initiated the building of the Monument at Richborough, he was unable to complete it.
Domitian eventually resumed Vespasian 's military agenda in Britain, culminating in the battle of Mons Graupius in A. D. 83.
Although many may have taken a harsh view of Domitian 's political agenda and its effects in Britain, Domitian took the opportunity provided by the Richborough Monument to place his own gloss on the events with a subsidiary inscription : « Perdomita Britannia ».
