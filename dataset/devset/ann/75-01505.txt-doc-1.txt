A comparison of the concepts of heresy and schism first in Tertullian 's « De monogamia » and « De baptismo », then in Cyprian 's « De unitate ecclesiae » and numerous Epistles, as well as other texts in which the terms occur.
« Haeresis » is a more common term than « schisma » from the beginning of the 3rd cent. until Cyprian 's death.
Though Cyprian and other bishops recognized a distinction between the two terms, there is no clear evidence as to what that was.
Cyprian did not believe that one could hold alternative views about theological matters such as the reconciliation of sinners, the validity of baptism in Christian sects, or anything else without leading to a break in communion with the Church.
