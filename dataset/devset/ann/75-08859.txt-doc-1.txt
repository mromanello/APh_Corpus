New evidence from Tiryns includes two groups of eastern derivation, wall brackets and armor scales, corresponding in their form and use to oriental prototypes.
Tiryns wall brackets are made locally with cultic connotation and employed in domestic and workshop cults.
They indicate the adoption of rituals using objects as dedications or apotropaic devices.
Potential for change brought about by such transmissions depended on whether society was willing to integrate the foreign traits into their world view.
