Analysis of all Latin inscriptions containing the word « deus » or « dea » from Tripolitania, Byzacium, Zeugitana, and Numidia shows that the epithet is mostly used with non-Roman divinities, especially Libyco-Punic but also oriental divinities.
When a divinity with a Roman name is qualified by « deus » or « dea » in the singular, there is a possibility that we have to do with a local divinity who has been made the object of an « interpretatio Romana ».
Although the title has value even when it is not accompanied by a particular adjective (e. g., « deus sanctus » or « patrius »), certain epithets (such as « inuictus » as applied to Mars) weaken the force of « deus », which then plays a secondary role.
When the epithet is found in the plural, it no longer has the same significance and simply provides a designation for the collective gods, whether foreign or Roman.
