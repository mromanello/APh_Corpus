In the Near Eastern provinces of the Roman empire in the century and a quarter between the Council of Nicaea and that of Chalcedon, both Greek and a number of Semitic languages or dialects were in use.
Study shows that the division of language use can be seen along communal, ethnic, and religious lines.
Greek was in universal use among pagans, Christians, Jews, and Samaritans.
The Christian Church used Greek as its predominant language, but differed from the traditional Greek pagan cities in allowing some use of Syriac.
But while Syriac was beginning to play an accepted role in the life of the Church, there was as yet no association between heresy and the use of languages other than Greek.
Jews and Samaritans were distinguished by the use of Hebrew, but they too used Aramaic/Syriac and Greek.
This period thus saw the origins, but not yet the fulfillment, of major ethnic/religious divisions
