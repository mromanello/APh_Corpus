Babies are prominent in Menander to a degree unusual in ancient drama.
The fact that they entered the iconography (in terracotta figurines, mosaics, and vase paintings) indicates that the scenes in which they appeared were memorable.
Babies provide reminders of such themes as Athenian male anxieties about illegitimacy or the dangers that might pose a threat to one 's freeborn status and privileges.
They constitute an important link in the action ; in « Samia » and « Epitrepontes » they act as a touchstone for the characterization.
