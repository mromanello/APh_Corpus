On Marian considerations in the thought of Irenaeus, concentrating on the hitherto neglected theme of co-recapitulation as it applies to Mary in the Irenaean corpus.
Confronting the question of what to make of Irenaeus ' assertions of an active, dynamic participation in the salvation process by the « obedient virgin », the possibility that Irenaeus is driven primarily by aesthetic concerns is dismissed, and a reading of Irenaeus is suggested that finds in Mary 's person an integral and essential component of a theologically coherent system of personal and social recapitulation.
