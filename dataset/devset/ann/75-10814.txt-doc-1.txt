Aurelian 's political and financial amnesties (Aurelius Victor 35, 7 ; Historia Augusta, Aurel. 39, 4) were modelled on similar amnesties declared by his predecessors.
By declaring such amnesties, Aurelian presented his rule as abiding by old practices and attempted to improve his relations with the senators who regarded him as an usurper.
Aurelian 's most visible reform, which introduced the cult of Sol as the new state cult, included the traditional renovation of the « pomerium », thus offering us a glimpse at a peculiar blend of innovations and traditions at this stage of the transformation of the Roman empire.
