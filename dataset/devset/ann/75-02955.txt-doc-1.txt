An ambiguity exists between normative and historical accounts of republican liberty.
Historical republican liberty, as seen in Livy 's narrative of the period following the expulsion of the Roman kings to the passage of the Licinian-Sextian laws (Books 1-10), was largely defensive, in the form of the tribunate.
Though republican liberty protected the plebeians from patrician abuse, removing them from a formal dependence analogous to that of slave or child in Roman law, it left them under the tutelage of a paternalistic order.
Thus, while historical republican liberty was anti-patriarchal, it was normatively compatible with paternalism.
Yet paternalism is probably undesirable for both normatively- and historically-minded advocates of republicanism.
