In 1775 a Roman bathhouse was discovered on the northwest slope of Golden Hill, Duntocher.
Although an account of the work was published by R. Gough (London, 1789), the excavation has been largely forgotten.
The present assessment draws upon Gough 's and other contemporary accounts.
Also presented is an account of the chance rediscovery of the bathhouse in 1978 and a geophysical survey undertaken by the Department of Archaeology, University of Glasgow, in 2001.
