The remains of the villa at North Leigh are known from excavations undertaken at various times but never completely published.
A new plan was produced in 1980 for the Official Handbook of the site, which also contained a summary account of the development of the plan of the villa ; see D. R. Wilson and D. Sherlock (=> 52-06982).
The present paper offers a detailed justification for that summary, based in substantial part on unpublished excavation records from 1910-1911 and 1956-1957, some of which are no longer extant.
Analysis of the resulting plan yields new information about the development and structural history of the villa buildings.
The evidence indicates that the development of the villa took place over a period covering at least most of the 2nd cent., all of the 3rd cent., and half of the 4th cent.
