M. Porcius Latro (quoted by Seneca, Controv. 2, 1, 1) used the enigmatic phrase « sub domino sectore ».
Latro 's reference to the flight of the commander of a « magnus exercitus » refers to Pompey ; the « sector » was Antony.
The fact that Antony was both owner/occupier (« dominus ») of Pompey 's choicest properties and the broker (« sector ») of the rest, will explain why Latro was able to use those two nouns to describe him.
TLL and OLD are both wrong to cite Seneca under the meaning of « dominus » in the sense of a « magister » who organizes a sale on behalf of a consortium of creditors, because Antony was not one of Pompey 's creditors.
