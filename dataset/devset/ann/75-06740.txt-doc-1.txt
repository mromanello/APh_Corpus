The durability of the literary tradition of winter is illustrated by texts from Latin literature of the late Republic and early Empire.
Just as winter is accompanied by warmth and the promise of the change of seasons, so the lover-poet sits comfortably by the fire as he protests his willingness to endure discomfort.
Although the poet presents himself as an energetic opponent of winter, he shares in winter 's idle and chilly nature.
Winter imagery is found, e. g., in Vergil, ecl. 10, 46-49 ; Propertius 4, 45-48 ; Horace, carm. 1, 9, 1-4 and 3, 25, 8-14.
