A condensed version of the annual report of the 2002 excavations carried out under the auspices of the Canadian Archaeological Institute at Athens.
There were two surveys : the Kamares Cave Project sought to reexamine the Minoan pottery from the Kamares Cave in Crete ; the other survey was the Southern Euboia Exploration Project.
Excavations by members of the CAIA included study seasons by the University of British Columbia teams at Mytilene and Stymphalos.
