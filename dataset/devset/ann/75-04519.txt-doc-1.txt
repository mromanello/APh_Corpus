In the Proem to the Aemilius-Timoleon pair, Plutarch describes his desire to mirror virtue in his biographies.
This mirroring encourages an active process of ethical development.
Plutarch wishes his readers to learn from weaknesses as well as strengths ; he expects his readers to distinguish what is admirable in a « Life » from what is not ; and he uses the pairing of Greek and Roman lives to heighten the mirroring effect.
