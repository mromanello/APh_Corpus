Publication of Greek inscriptions discovered during the survey of the Pisidian city at Melli directed by Dr. Lutgarde Vandeput and revisions to some texts published by G. H. R. Horsley and S. Mitchell (IK 57 => 71-09705).
These include several imperial statue bases from the city agora, four texts honoring city patrons, dedications and epitaphs.
The most significant discovery is the first identified Greek copy of a votive text to « the gods and goddesses », set up according to the interpretation of a Clarian oracle, and already known from nine Latin versions.
The inscription is associated with a cult room in a domestic building, and may be connected with the worship of Theos hypsistos.
