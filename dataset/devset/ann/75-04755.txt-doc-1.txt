The use of Sallust, one of the main classical authorities on Catiline, in the debate between Julian of Aeclanum and Augustine, has been neglected.
Textual evidence may be meagre : barely two literal citations in three of the extant fragments of Julian 's writings.
But Julian 's use of these, also compared with Jerome 's and Augustine 's, and the way his use of Sallust is reflected in the rest of his extant writing and thought gives the impression that he may have been far more deeply influenced by Sallust than has hitherto been thought.
