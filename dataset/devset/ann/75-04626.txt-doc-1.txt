Writing his « Vita Augustini » in the immediate aftermath of the Vandal invasions of Roman Africa, Possidius addresses his fellow African clerics and instructs them on how to respond to Arian Vandals in a post-Augustinian world.
He points his readers to Augustine 's monastic life and episcopal style as workable models that could lead to the conversion of the heretic invaders.
