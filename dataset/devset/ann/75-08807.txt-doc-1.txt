In the 2000 season, the Institute for Exploration carried out an archaeological survey by sidescan sonar and remotely-operated vehicles in the Black Sea.
The survey focused on exploration of the sea-bed about 15-30 km west of Sinop, Turkey.
Three shipwrecks, dating from the 4th to the 6th cents.
A. D., were found.
Shipping jars of a style associated with Sinop retain much of their original stacking pattern on these ships.
