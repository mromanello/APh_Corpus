J. Butrica argues (=> 73-00403) that Aristophanes ' lost « Thesmophoriazusae II » (frr. 331-358 Kassel-Austin) ought to be dated to the late 420s and may be the source of an anecdote in Satyros ' « Life of Euripides » about a hostile encounter between Euripides and Athens ' women.
Examination of the fragments and a detailed response to Butrica 's argument suggest that Aristophanes ' play must date to 416 or later, and that there is no positive evidence that Satyros knew it.
