The APh corpus was converted into the format read by `brat` using the following bash command

    for f in ~/Documents/APh_Corpus/iob/*txt; do python conll02tostandoff.py $f -o /Users/rromanello/Downloads/brat-v1.3rc2/data/aph/> tmp; mv tmp $f.ann; done

where `-o` is the output directory of choice. The parameter `~/Documents/APh_Corpus/iob/` should also be changed to match the path where the corpus is located.

Try this to rename .txt files

	for f in ./*.txt ;do fn=`echo $f|sed 's/\(.*\).txt-\(.*\)/\1.txt/'`; echo $fn $f; done
	
for .ann files should be

	for f in ./*.ann ;do fn=`echo $f|sed 's/\(.*\).txt-\(.*\)/\1.ann/'`; echo $fn $f; done
