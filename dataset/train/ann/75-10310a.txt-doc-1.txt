Re-examination of the text and interpretation of Avitus of Vienne, Epist. 46, p. 75, 2-4 ; p. 76, 3-8 and 16-17 Peiper, and Gregory of Tours, Franc. 2, 30, allows conclusions to be drawn relative to the date and circumstances of the baptism of Clovis.
The most probable terminus post quem for the baptism is A.D. 507.
The battle against the Alamanni mentioned by Gregory must date to late 506, but Gregory himself did not know when it took place in absolute terms and his relative chronology may be unreliable.
