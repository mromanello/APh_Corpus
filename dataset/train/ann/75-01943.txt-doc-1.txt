Sermons, particularly those dealing with local saints, preserved in the anonymous Eusebius Gallicanus collection reveal the ways in which preachers in 5th-cent. Gaul tried to build urban Christian communities. These sermons (11 ; 36 ; 55 ; 56) adapt a tradition of Christian language to the circumstances they faced, evoking a vision that is urban and localized, and that stands in contrast to more universal conceptions of Christian community.
