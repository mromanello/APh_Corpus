Contrary to the claim of D. Mulroy (=> 47-01005), the testimony of Hephaestion 's discussion of the galliambic metre (12.3) can indeed be used as evidence for the existence of a large number of Hellenistic poems in galliambics concerned with the cult of the Mother of the Gods.
This sheds light on the existence of possible Hellenistic models for Catullus 63.
