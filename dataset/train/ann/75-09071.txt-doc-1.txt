Publication of 33 Greek inscriptions found at Aphrodisias between 1995-2001, now in the Museum of Aphrodisias.
These include a posthumous honorary decree for a prominent local citizen (I 98.001) ; honorary inscriptions ; statue bases ; a dedication to Zeus Nineudios (I 99.002) ; building inscriptions ; gladiatorial monuments ; funerary inscriptions ; and a sundial. All of the inscriptions belong to the imperial period except the honorary decree and the dedication to Zeus Nineudios, both of which date to the 1st cent. B.C.
The most important new text is an honorary inscription on a statue base (I 01.001), set up by Alexander of Aphrodisias for his father, T. Aurelios Alexandros, discussed more fully elsewhere by the author (=> 75-00123).
