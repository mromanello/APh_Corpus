The archaeological evidence for the Serapis ' temple form and phases has never been fully analyzed.
When the records of the remains uncovered in ca. 1900 are combined with those of the excavations during World War II (A. Rowe [ => BSAA 1941-1942 35 ; APh 20, p. 192 ] ; A. Rowe and B. R. Rees [ => APh 28, p. 308, under Rowe, 2nd title ]), their analysis reveals sufficient evidence to suggest reconstructions of both the Ptolemaic and Roman phases of the complex.
The archaeological evidence also elucidates the information in the written sources about the conversion of the site to Christian use after A.D. 391.
Previously-unpublished architectural fragments excavated in ca. 1900 suggest that the architecture of the Ptolemaic sanctuary was Greek, not Egyptian, in style.
