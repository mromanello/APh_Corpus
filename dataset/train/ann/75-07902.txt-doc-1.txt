The Crusader castle (now called « Saranda Kolones ») on the ancient site of Paphos was built and occupied c. A.D. 1192-1222.
It overlies and partly truncates a series of ancient features such as tombs, cisterns, wells, and church remains.
The layers associated with these contain rich deposits spanning a period from the 4th cent. B.C. to the 8th/ 9th cents. A.D. Some 410 pottery items from the pre-Castle phases are presented here, mostly in a series of 16 selected deposits arranged in chronological order.
These range from early tomb-groups to stratified well fills and an important destruction deposit of c. A.D. 650.
