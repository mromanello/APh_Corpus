The Latin funerary inscription known as the « Laudatio Turiae » (CIL 6, 41062) should be regarded not as a disinterested description of a woman 's life, but rather as a subjective narrative written by her husband with an eye to eliciting a positive response from his audience.
Turia 's public activities and the virtues attributed to her may be compared to those of other women living in the same period.
The impression conveyed is that Turia 's unusual public activities were the result of exceptional circumstances and, therefore, did not affect the norm of female domesticity.
Her « fides », « pietas », and other traditional female virtues were stressed to justify her actions.
