Commentators are puzzled as to what constellation is denoted by « sidus Piscis aquosi » at georg. 4, 234.
Emendation of « piscis » to « pestis » was proposed by E. L. Brown (=> 54-05440).
This emendation should be kept, and « aquosi » should be emended to « aquosae ».
The « sidus Pestis aquosae » may be identified as the Hydra.
A reference to Hydra would look back to Vergil 's disquisition on snakes in georg. 3, 414-439 and his interest in serpentine constellations in georg. 1, 205 and 244-245 ; it would also look forward to the death of Eurydice in georg. 4, 457-459.
