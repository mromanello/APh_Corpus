An obvious model for Aeneas ' narration of his voyage around Sicily at the end of Aen. 3 is Callimachus ' « Aetia ».
Expansion of M. Geymonat 's exploration of this topic (=> 64-06516) allows discussion of two examples of poetic reference.
First, Vergil 's reference to Gela at 3, 702 may be modelled on Callimachus, Aetia 2, fr. 43, 46.
Second, Aetia 2, fr. 43, 68-72 may have influenced Vergil 's treatment of the death of Anchises at Drepanum at 3, 707-710.
