Among the plants that frequently appear in pastoral poetry are beech trees (Vergil, ecl. 1, 1 and 2, 3 ; Calpurnius Siculus 1, 11) ; trefoil or « cytisus » (Columella 5, 12, 1 ; Vergil, ecl. 1, 74 and 2, 64) ; hazel (ecl. 1, 14) ; rushes (Theocritus 5, 45 ; Vergil, ecl. 1, 48) ; « uiburnum » (ecl. 1, 19) ; stone pines (Theocritus 5, 49 ; Vergil, ecl. 7, 65) ; and others.
The poetry of Vergil and Theocritus is rich in plants, trees, and herbs. Calpurnius and Nemesianus include considerably fewer flora.
Animals that inhabit the pastoral world are varied and plentiful.
