Homer recounts not only Achilles ' wrath against Agamemnon « which laid countless woes upon the Achaeans » (Il. 1, 2), but also his wrath against Hector after Hector has killed Patroclus and after Achilles has formally abjured his wrath against Agamemnon (19, 67-68).
Neither this second anger nor Achilles ' compassion toward Priam in 24, 516 is mentioned in its opening lines as themes of the poem.
The thematic core of the conception of Homer 's « Iliad » is not so much anger itself as the relation between pity and anger.
