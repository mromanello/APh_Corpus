Scholars have assumed that the imperial box in the Colosseum was located on the southern side, an assumption that has never been substantiated and is problematic.
By using numismatic evidence that shows the emperor sitting on the northern side of the Flavian amphitheater (BMCRE 156 ; 190 ; 319 ; ANS 1954.203.170 ; Grueber 13) and by making some observations on the literary sources (e.g., Suetonius, Vesp. 9, 1), it can be demonstrated that the northern side of the short axis was the location of the imperial box.
