At Lucan 2, 691-692 the season of Pompey's escape from Brundisium is set by the rising of two zodiacal signs : Chelae and Virgo. Lucan was not confused as to which signs of the zodiac represented the season ; the narrative of the poem provides evidence to suggest a deliberate chronological alteration. Virgo may be identified with the figure of departed Justice ; Chelae is related by name and figure to Scorpio, who symbolizes war in astrology. Figulus' prophecies about the coming civil war in 1, 658-663 represent another stellar « slip » in the poem, for Figulus' horoscope does not coincide with any historical date and does not amount to a factual description of the night sky, but rather to an idiosyncratic piece of astrological manipulation.
