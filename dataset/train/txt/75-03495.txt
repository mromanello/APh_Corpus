Although much of the advice in the « Remedia » is the reverse of that given in the « Ars », the advice of the « Remedia » is in no way opposed to that given in the « Ars ». In fact, the two texts work in tandem, pulling their reader into an inescapable circle of elegiac love. The « Remedia » are disingenuous in their claims to cure love. Since true relief from erotic suffering comes only from new love (Rem. 441-442 and 487-488), the student of the « Remedia » will always return eventually to the « Ars ».
