Hesiod's use of admonitory stories (Op. 47-211) has long been recognized as problematic. His nuanced opening moves may reveal some of the traits that endeared him to the Hellenistic poets and their Roman successors. A comparative reading of the « Contest of Homer and Hesiod » may help us make paradoxical sense of the « Works and days » at the level both of structure and of the individual episode. The « Contest » reads most straightforwardly as a fantasy play-off between tongue-in-cheek stereotypes ; it is far from straightforward in its ratification of a didactic Hesiod.
