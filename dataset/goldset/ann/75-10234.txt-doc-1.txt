Proposes a new explanation as to why Nero cancelled proposed trips abroad twice in quick succession in early 64 AD, first a trip to Achaia, and then a trip to the East.

New light is also shed on the circumstances leading to the prosecution and suicide of Decimus Iunius Silanus Torquatus about the same time as the cancellation of the first trip
