Although sources assert that Caesar and Antony were estranged in 46-45 B. C., their quarrel is a fiction invented by Cicero, Phil. 2, 71-74.
Plutarch, Ant. 10, 3 and Dio 45, 28, 2-3 drew on Cicero 's account.
The panic caused in Rome by Antony 's arrival in March 45 (Cicero, Att. 12, 19, 2 ; Phil. 2, 77-78) suggests that contemporaries regarded him as someone whom Caesar might well call upon to initiate a bloody purge.
Antony also canvassed voters for the consulship of 44 (Phil. 2, 76), an office he could hardly have hoped to win without Caesar 's blessing.
