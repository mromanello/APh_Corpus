Cicero seems to have avoided the first-person plural of the present indicative of « fero » and its compounds.
Since « fero » and its numerous compounds are common words, this is unlikely to be coincidence.
The reason for this is not obvious : perhaps doubts about the correct form could have been created by « fers, fert, fertis ».
One place where we should expect to find « ferimus », if it was regarded as a legitimate form, is Seneca.
The PHI Latin Texts CD 5.3 gives one instance only, « praeferimus » at Seneca ben. 4, 3, 1 ; the form is a manuscript conjecture.
