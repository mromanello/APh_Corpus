In his speech « Against Eratosthenes », Lysias calls for revenge against the murderers of Polemarchus.
In Plato 's « Republic », however, Socrates convinces Polemarchus, in the presence of Lysias, that harming enemies is unjust (331 D-336 A).
Socrates ' argument focuses on problems and assumptions that turn out to be key features of Lysias ' indictment of Eratosthenes.
Socrates ' conversation with Polemarchus is on one level a Platonic reply to « Against Eratosthenes ».
Plato 's implicit criticisms of Lysias in the « Republic » harmonize with the picture of Lysias that he inscribes explicitly in the « Phaedrus » (269 D-279 B).
