Winter has a consistent and not insignificant role in the Aristophanic corpus.
While occasionally Aristophanes characterizes bad poetry as being cold (Au. 1385 ; Ach. 9-11), most often he views cold as the common people 's enemy, as it prevents them from living comfortably (e.g., Th. 67-69 ; V. 445-446).
