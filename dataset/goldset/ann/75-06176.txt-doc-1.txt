Vergil has been appropriated for many different perspectives on the world.
These appropriations involve assimilations that tend to erase the particularly Roman aspects of Vergil.
It is important to make, or keep, Vergil strange, especially in the area of translation.
A defamiliarizing reading of Aen. 1, 1-11 helps to illustrate how some English translations of the « Aeneid » map onto the spectrum of assimilation-dissimilation.
