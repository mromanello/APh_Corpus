Analysis of the evidence regarding Kephisophon, the associate of Euripides mentioned by Aristophanes (Ra. 944 and 1407-1410 ; and elsewhere) indicates that he collaborated with Euripides in the composition of music.
This collaboration is to be viewed in the context of a pattern of increasing specialization that made the creation of dramas more a team job.
The allegation that Kephisophon cuckolded Euripides arose because their association began at about the time (411-408 B.C.) when Euripides married a woman much younger than himself.
