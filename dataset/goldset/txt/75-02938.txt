Following his contested election, Pope Damasus (A.D. 366-384) « found numerous saints' bodies that he glorified in verse » (Lib. pontif. p. 83, 34 Mommsen) in the catacombs of Rome. By placing Vergilian epigrams on large marble blocks in a number of martyr shrines, engraved by a master artist, Damasus contributed his own theory of martyrdom to the Catholic spirituality of the 4th cent. and discovered a medium of divine affirmation for his uncertain position as bishop.
